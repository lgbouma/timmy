\title{Cluster Difference Imaging Photometric Survey (CDIPS) II: A Jupiter-Sized Planet in IC~2602}

\input{authors.tex}

\begin{abstract}
We report the discovery of the transiting planet TOI 837.01,
a warm Jupiter-sized planet ($R_{\rm p} = 10.XX\,R_\oplus$, $P =
8.YY\,{\rm d}$), with mass less than X.XX $M_{\rm Jup}$.
TOI$\,$837.01 orbits a V=10.6, T=9.9 G-dwarf in IC~2602, also known as the
``Southern Pleiades'', and is therefore 50 million years old.
We characterize the system using data from the NASA {\it Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite} (TESS), the ESA Gaia mission,
ground-based photometry, and spectroscopy from CTIO1.5/CHIRON,
XXX/FEROS, and AAT/Veloce.
TOI 837.01 joins the growing ranks of adolescent exoplanets orbiting
bright host stars, and is amenable for studies of planetary
atmospheric and orbital evolution.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{TESS Photometry}

\tn\ (TIC 460205581, GAIA DR2 5251470948229949568) was observed by the
TESS spacecraft from X to Y in two-minute cadence mode.

Figure~\ref{fig:rawzoom}.

\subsection{Ground-based Time-Series Photometry}

\subsection{Imaging}

\subsection{Spectroscopy}

\subsubsection{CHIRON}
9 spectra with CTIO1.5/CHIRON, from January 28 through March 14, 2020.
6 were usable.

\subsubsection{FEROS}
N spectra with XXX/FEROS

\subsubsection{Veloce}
M spectra with AAT/Veloce.

\subsection{Astrometry}


\section{The Star}
\label{sec:star}

\subsection{The Cluster}
\label{subsec:cluster}

% NOTE: might want a table of all ages

IC~2602 canonically has an age of $30\pm20\,{\rm Myr}$ (CITE: Van
Leeuwen 2009).
Or logage between 7.533 and 7.563	\citep{bossini_age_2019}.

Or Li age of 40-50Myr (David+19, comparison with other Li stars).

Reported mean metallicity values ${\rm [Fe/H]}$ for the cluster range between
slightly super-solar ($0.04\pm0.01$, \citealt{baratella_gaia-eso_2020}) and
slightly sub-solar ($-0.02 \pm 0.02$, \citealt{netopil_metallicity_2016}).

IC~2602 is supervirial, in the sense that the observed stellar velocity
dispersion is larger than the value expected if it were in virial equilibrium
by about a factor of two \citep{bravi_gaia-eso_2018}.


\subsection{Cluster Membership}
\label{subsec:member}

The Gaia kinematics are good; gamma velocity is correct; Li (FEROS +
Veloce) is strong; the rotation period and vsini agree with
sub-Pleiades age expected for an IC 2602 member.

\subsubsection{Kinematics}

Gaia

\subsubsection{Rotation}

TESS photometric rotation period = 3.5days ish.

vsini = 17.48 $\pm$ 0.15 (CHIRON).

The two agree.

For comparison, gyrochrones would predict X.XX.

This implies sub-Pleiades age expected for an IC 2602 member.

\subsubsection{Lithium}

Rafael's co-added FEROS spectra gave a Li doublet equivalent width of
154 milliangstrom (see attached).

As a reminder, Teff=6100K (TICv8). 
Or Teff = 5946 $\pm$ 39 (CHIRON).
Rafael, if you have a better
determination of Teff, it would be helpful!  SpType is early-G,
late-F from your quicklook spectral typing earlier.

Relevant colors are V-K = 1.7,  V-I ~= V-T = 0.7

Summarizing relevant lithium facts:

Lithium depletion for a star of TOI-837's spectral type happens
over timescales >100 Myr (Soderblom+2013). This is because the
convective envelopes are very shallow, so they don't cycle material
down to the >3e6 K core until much later.

Nonetheless, comparison of early-G field stars to e.g., 600 Myr old
Hyads shows that the depletion does happen over gigayear timescales
(Berger+2018, fig 7).

Comparing to the Li EWs measured by Berger+2018 (their Fig 5),
TOI-837 is consistent with being younger than almost all CKS
planet-hosting field stars.

The TOI-837 Li EW measured here (150 milliangstrom) is consistent
with what's seen for stars of similar colors in <100 Myr old moving
groups (Elliott+2016, Fig 11 -- attached).  This is sensible, because
IC 2602 is supposed to be 50 Myr old.


\subsubsection{Literature Membership}
The membership of \tn\ in \cn\ was noted by \citet{oh_comoving_2017},
in what they dubbed ``Group 5''.
Analyzing the clusters of \citet{oh_comoving_2017},
\citet{bochanski_fundamental_2018} fitted the Gaia, 2MASS, and
WISE photometry with MIST isochrones, and reported stellar masses,
radii, metallicities, ages, distances, and extinction for 9754 stars,
including \tn.

\tn\ was also listed as a member of ``Theia 92'' by
\citet{kounkel_untangling_2019}.
These authors identified 999 candidate cluster members, and
reported a cluster isochrone age $\log t = 7.55$ with uncertainty
$\approx 0.15\,{\rm dex}$.


\subsection{Stellar Parameters}

\begin{figure}[t!]

    photometry.}

    \label{fig:sed}
	}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Physical}
 (Lstar, Rstar, Teff, Age and Mstar)

Figure~\ref{fig:sed}.

\paragraph{Astrometric information}
The RUWE (CITE, CITE) for \tn\ is 1.02, indicative that there are no
obviously present astometric companions.


\subsubsection{Rotation}
Stellar vsini
Stellar rotation

\subsection{RVs}
I don't strongly expect the Veloce RVs or the FEROS ones to lead to a
mass measurement. The reason is that with vsini=17km/s, and 2\%
rotation amplitude signal, we expect an RV RMS of 300m/s at the
Prot=3.5 day rotation period (vsini*rotation amplitude). This is
probably larger than the expected planet signal (100m/s, 8 days).



\section{The Planet}
\label{sec:planet}

\begin{figure}[t]

	\end{center}
	\vspace{-0.7cm}
	\caption{ {\bf Scene used for blend analysis.}
    {\it Top:} Mean TESS image of \tn\ over Sector~10, with a
    logarithmic grayscale. The yellow star is the position of \tn.
    Orange circles are neighboring stars with $T<16$, scaled such that
    brighter stars are larger. The \texttt{X} and \texttt{/} hatches
    show the apertures used to measure the background and target star
    flux, respectively. Dashed lines of constant declination and right
    ascension are shown.  {\it Bottom:} Digitized Sky Survey $R$-band
    image of the same field, with a linear grayscale. The circles show
    apertures of radii 1, 1.5, and 2.25 pixels used in our blend
    analysis (Section~\ref{subsec:validation}).  Two stars of interest
    are ``Star A'' and ``Star B'', which were eventually excluded as
    being possible sources of the transits.
		\label{fig:scene}
	}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t]
	\begin{center}
		\leavevmode
		\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{f4.pdf}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-0.7cm}
	\caption{ 
		{\bf SOAR HRCam contrast limits derived from point-source
			injection-recovery experiments.} 
      Star A ($\Delta T=4.7$, $\rho=2.3$'' west) is detected in the
      autocorrelation function, in addition to being a resolved Gaia
      source.
      It is co-moving with \tn, and
      its parallax and on-sky position imply that
      it is physically separated from \tn\ by $6.6\pm 0.1\,{\rm pc}$.
		\label{fig:soar}
	}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Transit Fitting}
Simultaneous dip plus rotation period (GP) fit. Use celerite plus PyMC3/exoplanet.
Mention FPP?


\subsection{Validation of \pn}

Exclude possibilities:
"The transits are blended from a background, unassociated eclipsing binary
system or transiting exoplanet: We take the same approach outlined in
Vanderburg et al. (2019). In short, if the transits are a blend from the
background system, the true radius ratio is constrained by the ratio of the
ingress time (T12) to the..."


\subsubsection{Visual Binarity}
Figure~\ref{fig:scene} shows the scene.
In the upper panels, the pixels used to measure the background level
in the SPOC lightcurve are indicated with `\texttt{X}' hatching, and
the pixels used in the final lightcurve aperture are shown with
`\texttt{/}' hatching.

Stars brighter than $T=16$, as queried from the Gaia DR2 source
catalog, are shown with orange circles.
The relevant stars for a blend analysis are as follows.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \tn\ = TIC 460205581 (T=9.9). The target star.
  \item Star A = TIC 847769574 (T=14.6). $2.3$'' west. Proper motions
    and parallax imply it is comoving with \tn, though with a physical
    separation of $6.6\pm 0.1\,{\rm pc}$, it may not be bound.
  \item Star B = TIC 460205587 (T=13.1). $5.4$'' north.  This is a
    giant background star.
\end{itemize}
An additional source, TIC 847769581, is $4.9$'' from the target, but
too faint (T=18.8) to be the source of the observed transit signal.

The Gaia DR2 data for Star A seems somewhat poorly behaved.  While
Star A has $G=15.1$, and $Bp=14.9$, no $Rp$ magnitude is reported.
Correspondingly, no RUWE value is available (CITE).  The astrometric
reduced $\chi^2$ ($\chi^2 / (N-5)$, for $N$ the number of good
astrometric observations) seems rather poor, at $8.6$.  We suspect
that the photometric failure to produce an $Rp$ magnitude, as well as
the poor astrometric fit, are likely due to blending with \tn.

At the angular resolution of the TESS data, if either Star A or Star B
were eclipsing binaries, they could be the sources of the transit
signal.  Coincidence stellar sources below the resolution limit of
Gaia are also a concern (CITE). To rule out these possibilities, we
took a number of approaches.


\subsubsection{High-resolution imaging}

We imaged the system using SOAR-HRCam.
{\bf Carl: please describe}.
Figure~\ref{fig:soar}.
\citet{ziegler_soar_2020}


\subsubsection{TESS analysis}

We examined the CDIPS FFI lightcurves of the target, which are
available on MAST \citep{bouma_cluster_2019}. Three lightcurves are
available, based on photometric apertures with a radius of 1, 1.5, or
2.5 pixels.  In the raw difference-image light-curves, as well as the
PCA-detrended light-curves, dips of depth $\approx$0.35\% are visible,
and their properties do not significantly vary with aperture size.
Within $\approx20$'', the dips are consistent with originating from
the target star.

\subsubsection{Seeing-limited time-series photometry}

%FIXME:
{\bf left off here}
Co-author P{.} Evans obtained a total transit that showed that, within
1.5'', the transit comes from \tn.  We can be even more certain with a
pixel-level analysis. This 2.1 arcsec neighbor is also a mid to late M
dwarf, and bound given the Gaia parallax + proper motion. The transit
duration is rather long for the signal to come from the M dwarf,
rather than the G dwarf.  I think the state of photometric followup
could be improved (there is only one good total transit), but I think
over this month and next we can pull another few partials.

A total eclipse of Ziegler's faint companion would produce a 1.4\%
dip. A 30\% eclipse, more plausible for a NEB scenario, would produce
dips at exactly the right depth (0.4\%).

\subsubsection{Summary}

Possible false-positive scenarios are as follows.

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\it Neighboring blends}.

  \item {\it Hierarchical blends}.
    Limited by i) FEROS + Veloce RVs, and ii) the star being nicely on the
    cluster HR diagram. Any extra hidden close-in binary stars would
    need to be very low-mass M dwarfs, and then the transit duration
    again helps.

  \item {\it Background blends}.
  Archival imaging (POSS) available in the south?
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Additional Companions}

None of the extra dips in the PDCSAP light-curve (e.g., ``up-down''
spikes at BTJD 1572 and 1601) seem likely to be planetary
We checked that i) they were not present in the SAPFLUX light-curves,
and ii) that they were not present in the CDIPS light-curves (either
raw, or PCA-detrended).

To make this quantitative, we did injection-recovery.
