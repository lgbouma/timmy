	abstract = {The Kepler Mission was designed to identify and characterize transiting 
planets in the Kepler Field of View and to determine their occurrence
rates. Emphasis was placed on identification of Earth-size planets
orbiting in the Habitable Zone of their host stars. Science data were
acquired for a period of four years. Long-cadence data with 29.4 min
sampling were obtained for ∼200,000 individual stellar targets in at
least one observing quarter in the primary Kepler Mission. Light curves
for target stars are extracted in the Kepler Science Data Processing
Pipeline, and are searched for transiting planet signatures. A Threshold
Crossing Event is generated in the transit search for targets where the
transit detection threshold is exceeded and transit consistency checks
are satisfied. These targets are subjected to further scrutiny in the
Data Validation (DV) component of the Pipeline. Transiting planet
candidates are characterized in DV, and light curves are searched for
additional planets after transit signatures are modeled and removed. A
suite of diagnostic tests is performed on all candidates to aid in
discrimination between genuine transiting planets and instrumental or
astrophysical false positives. Data products are generated per target
and planet candidate to document and display transiting planet model fit
and diagnostic test results. These products are exported to the
Exoplanet Archive at the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute, and are
available to the community. We describe the DV architecture and
diagnostic tests, and provide a brief overview of the data products.
Transiting planet modeling and the search for multiple planets on
individual targets are described in a companion paper. The final
revision of the Kepler Pipeline code base is available to the general
public through GitHub. The Kepler Pipeline has also been modified to
support the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Mission which
is expected to commence in 2018.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the transit model-fitting and multiple-planet search algorithms and performance of the Kepler Science Data Processing Pipeline, developed by the Kepler Science Operations Center (SOC). Threshold crossing events (TCEs), which are transit candidate events, are generated by the Transiting Planet Search (TPS) component of the pipeline and subsequently processed in the data validation (DV)
component. The transit model is used in DV to fit TCEs to characterize planetary candidates and to derive parameters that are used in various diagnostic tests to classify them. After the signature associated with the TCE is removed from the light curve of the target star, the residual light curve goes through TPS again to search for additional TCEs. The iterative process of transit model-fitting and multiple-planet search continues until no TCE is generated from the residual light curve or an upper limit is reached. The transit model-fitting and multiple-planet search performance of the final release (9.3, 2016 January) of the pipeline is demonstrated with the results of the processing of four years (17 quarters) of flight data from the primary Kepler Mission. The transit model-fitting results are accessible from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. The final version of the SOC codebase is available through GitHub.},

	abstract = {We present a new, simple method to predict activity-induced radial 
velocity (RV) variations using high-precision time series photometry. It
is based on insights from a simple spot model, has only two free
parameters (one of which can be estimated from the light curve) and does
not require knowledge of the stellar rotation period. We test the method
on simulated data and illustrate its performance by applying it to
MOST/SOPHIE observations of the planet host star HD 189733, where it
gives almost identical results to much more sophisticated but highly
degenerate models, and synthetic data for the Sun, where we demonstrate
that it can reproduce variations well below the m s-1 level.
We also apply it to quarter 1 data for Kepler transit candidate host
stars, where it can be used to estimate RV variations down to the 2-3 m
s-1 level, and show that RV amplitudes above that level may
be expected for approximately two-thirds of the candidates we examined.

Throughout this paper, we use amplitude spectra computed by linear
least-squares fitting of a sinusoid with free zero-point, amplitude and
phase at each frequency. This is akin to the generalized periodogram of
Zechmeister \& Kürster (2009) but expressed in units of
amplitude rather than χ2 reduction.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13731},
	abstract = {Exoplanet atmospheres are known to be vulnerable to mass loss through irradiation by stellar X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet emission. We investigate how this high-energy irradiation varies with time by combining an empirical relation describing stellar X-ray emission with a second relation describing the ratio of Solar X-ray to extreme-ultraviolet emission. In contrast to assumptions commonly made when modelling atmospheric escape, we find that the decline in stellar extreme-ultraviolet emission is much slower than in X-rays, and that the total extreme-ultraviolet irradiation of planetary atmospheres is dominated by emission after the saturated phase of high energy emission (which lasts around 100 Myr after the formation of the star). Furthermore, we find that the total combined X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet emission of stars also occurs mostly after this saturated phase. Our results suggest that models of atmospheric escape that focus on the saturated phase of high-energy emission are over-simplified, and when considering the evolution of planetary atmospheres it is necessary to follow EUV-driven escape on Gyr timescales. This may make it more difficult to use stellar age to separate the effects of photoevaporation and core-powered mass-loss when considering the origin the planet radius valley.},

	abstract = {Some recently discovered short-period Earth- to Neptune-sized exoplanets (super-Earths) have low observed mean densities that can only be explained by voluminous gaseous atmospheres. Here, we study the
conditions allowing the accretion and retention of such atmospheres. We self-consistently couple the nebular gas accretion onto rocky cores and the subsequent evolution of gas envelopes following the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Specifically, we address mass-loss due to both photo-evaporation and cooling of the planet. We find that planets shed their outer layers (dozens of percent in mass) following the disk's dispersal (even without photo-evaporation), and their atmospheres shrink in a few Myr to a thickness comparable to the radius of the underlying rocky core. At this stage, atmospheres containing less particles than the core (equivalently, lighter than a few percent of the planet's mass) can be blown away by heat coming from the cooling core, while heavier atmospheres cool and contract on a timescale of Gyr at most. By relating the mass-loss timescale to the accretion time, we analytically identify a Goldilocks region in the mass-temperature plane in which low-density super-Earths can be found: planets have to be massive and cold enough to accrete and retain their atmospheres, but not too massive or cold, such that they do not enter runaway accretion and become gas giants
(Jupiters). We compare our results to the observed super-Earth
population and find that low-density planets are indeed concentrated in the theoretically allowed region. Our analytical and intuitive model can be used to investigate possible super-Earth formation scenarios.},

	abstract = {The Moon is thought to have formed from debris ejected by a giant impact 
with the early `proto'-Earth and, as a result of the high energies
involved, the Moon would have melted to form a magma ocean. The
timescales for formation and solidification of the Moon can be
quantified by using 182Hf-182W and
146Sm-142Nd chronometry, but these methods have
yielded contradicting results. In earlier studies, 182W
anomalies in lunar rocks were attributed to decay of 182Hf
within the lunar mantle and were used to infer that the Moon solidified
within the first {\textasciitilde}60 million years of the Solar System. However, the
dominant 182W component in most lunar rocks reflects
cosmogenic production mainly by neutron capture of 181Ta
during cosmic-ray exposure of the lunar surface, compromising a reliable
interpretation in terms of 182Hf-182W chronometry.
Here we present tungsten isotope data for lunar metals that do not
contain any measurable Ta-derived 182W. All metals have
identical 182W/184W ratios, indicating that the
lunar magma ocean did not crystallize within the first {\textasciitilde}60Myr of the
Solar System, which is no longer inconsistent with Sm-Nd chronometry.
Our new data reveal that the lunar and terrestrial mantles have
identical 182W/184W. This, in conjunction with
147Sm-143Nd ages for the oldest lunar rocks,
constrains the age of the Moon and Earth to Myr after formation of the
Solar System. The identical 182W/184W ratios of
the lunar and terrestrial mantles require either that the Moon is
derived mainly from terrestrial material or that tungsten isotopes in
the Moon and Earth's mantle equilibrated in the aftermath of the giant
impact, as has been proposed to account for identical oxygen isotope
compositions of the Earth and Moon.},

of transiting planet candidates in the Kepler field, and calculate
effective temperature, radius, mass, and luminosity with typical errors
of 57 K, 7\%, 11\%, and 13\%, respectively. We find systematic offsets
between our values and those from previous analyses of the same stars,
which we attribute to differences in atmospheric models utilized for
each study. We investigate which of the planets in this sample are
likely to orbit in the circumstellar habitable zone. We determine that
four candidate planets (KOI 854.01, 1298.02, 1686.01, and 2992.01) are
inside of or within 1σ of a conservative definition of the
habitable zone, but that several planets identified by previous analyses
are not (e.g., KOI 1422.02 and KOI 2626.01). Only one of the four
habitable-zone planets is Earth sized, suggesting a downward revision in
the occurrence of such planets around M dwarfs. These findings highlight
the importance of measuring accurate stellar parameters when deriving
parameters of their orbiting planets.},

Despite their large number in the Galaxy, M dwarfs remain elusive objects and the modeling of their photosphere has long remained a challenge (molecular opacities, dust cloud formation). Aims: Our objectives are to validate the BT-Settl model atmospheres, update the M dwarf Teff-spectral type relation, and find the atmospheric parameters of the stars in our sample. Methods: We compare two samples of optical spectra covering the whole M dwarf sequence with the most recent BT-Settl synthetic spectra and use a χ2 minimization technique to determine Teff. The first sample consists of 97 low-resolution spectra obtained with New Technology Telescope (NTT) at La Silla Observatory. The second sample contains 55 medium-resolution spectra obtained at the Siding Spring Observatory (SSO). The spectral typing is realized by comparison with already classified M dwarfs. Results: We show that the BT-Settl synthetic spectra reproduce the slope of the spectral energy
distribution and most of its features. Only the CaOH band at 5570 Å and AlH and NaH hydrides in the blue part of the spectra are
still missing in the models. The Teff scale obtained with the higher resolved SSO 2.3 m spectra is consistent with that obtained with the NTT spectra. We compare our Teff scale with those of other authors and with published isochrones using the BT-Settl colors. We also present relations between effective temperature, spectral type, and colors of the M dwarfs.

Applying Zeeman-Doppler Imaging (ZDI) to our observations, concentrating in 2015 November and 2016 January and spanning 72 d in total, 16 d in 2015 November and 13 d in 2016 January, we reconstruct surface brightness and magnetic field maps for both epochs and demonstrate that both distributions exhibit temporal evolution not explained by differential rotation alone. We report the detection of a hot Jupiter (hJ) around TAP 26 using three different methods, two using ZDI and one Gaussian-process regression (GPR), with a false-alarm probability smaller than 6 × 10-4. However, as a result of the aliasing related to the observing window, the orbital period cannot be uniquely determined; the orbital period with highest likelihood is 10.79 ± 0.14 d followed by 8.99 ± 0.09 d.
Assuming the most likely period, and that the planet orbits in the stellar equatorial plane, we obtain that the planet has a minimum mass Msin I of 1.66 ± 0.31 MJup and orbits at 0.0968

The fraction of accreting stars decreases from {\textasciitilde}60\% at 1.5-2 Myr to {\textasciitilde}2\% at 10 Myr. No accreting stars are found after 10 Myr at a sensitivity limit of 10-11 M⊙ yr-1.

yr-1, while {\textasciitilde}20\% of the stars show near-infrared excess emission. Assuming an exponential decay, we measure a mass accretion timescale (τ\_acc) of 2.3 Myr, compared to a near-to-mid infrared excess timescale (τ\_IRAC) of 3 Myr. Planet formation and/or
migration, in the inner disk might be a viable mechanism to halt further accretion onto the central star on such a short timescale.

Comparing these observed characteristics with recent theoretical models, we find that HAT-P-16b is consistent with a 1 Gyr H/He-dominated gas giant planet. HAT-P-16b resides in a sparsely populated region of the mass-radius diagram and has a non-zero eccentricity of e = 0.036 with a significance of 10σ.

Our new simulations differ from previous work by using (1) an updated photometric noise model that accounts for the nominal pointing jitter estimated through simulation prior to launch, (2) improved stellar parameters based on Gaia mission Data Release 2, (3) improved empirically-based simulation of multi-planet systems, (4) a realistic method of selecting targets for 2-minute exposures, and (5) a more realistic geometric distortion model to determine the sky region that falls on TESS CCDs. We also present simulations of the planet yield for three suggested observing strategies of the TESS extended mission. We report {\textasciitilde}\$10{\textasciicircum}4\$ planets to be discovered by the TESS primary mission, as well as an additional \${\textbackslash}sim 2000\$ planets for each year of the three extended mission scenarios we explored. We predict that in the primary mission, TESS will discover about 3500 planets with Neptune size and smaller, half of which will orbit stars with TESS magnitudes brighter than 12. Specifically, we proposed a new extended mission scenario that centers Camera 3 on the ecliptic pole (C3PO), which will yield more long period planets as well as moderately irradiated planets that orbit F, G, and K stars.},

To provide a head start to those who will plan and propose for such a mission, we present simulations of exoplanet detections in a third year of TESS operations. Our goal is to provide a helpful reference for the exoplanet-related aspects of any Extended Mission, while recognizing this will be only one part of a larger community discussion of the scientific goals. We use Monte Carlo simulations to try and anticipate the quantities and types of planets that would be detected in each of 6 plausible scenarios for a one-year Extended Mission following the two-year Primary Mission. We find that: (1) there is no sharp fall-off in the planet discovery rate in the third year; (2) the quantity of newly detected sub-Neptune radius planets does not depend strongly on the schedule of pointings; (3) an important function of an Extended Mission would be improving our ability to predict the times of future transits and occultations of TESS-detected planets.},

	stellar properties derived using Gaia Data Release 2 by Berger et al.
	(2020), we re-compute Kepler planet radii and incident fluxes and
	investigate their distributions with stellar mass and age. We measure
	the stellar mass dependence of the planet radius valley to be \$d {\textbackslash}log
	R\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{p\}\}\$/\$d {\textbackslash}log M\_{\textbackslash}star = 0.26{\textasciicircum}\{+0.21\}\_\{-0.16\}\$, consistent with
	the slope predicted by a planet mass dependence on stellar mass
	(\$0.24-0.35\$) and core-powered mass-loss (0.33). We also find first
	evidence of a stellar age dependence of the planet populations
	straddling the radius valley. Specifically, we determine that the
	fraction of super-Earths (\$1-1.8 {\textbackslash}mathrm\{R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$) to sub-Neptunes
	(\$1.8-3.5 {\textbackslash}mathrm\{R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$) increases from \$0.61 {\textbackslash}pm 0.09\$ at young

	consistent with the prediction by core-powered mass-loss that the
	mechanism shaping the radius valley operates over Gyr timescales.
	Additionally, we find a tentative decrease in the radii of relatively
	cool (\$F\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{p\}\} {\textless} 150 {\textbackslash}mathrm\{F\_{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$) sub-Neptunes over Gyr
	timescales, which suggests that these planets may possess H/He envelopes

	orbiting more evolved stars compared to other planets at similar
	incident fluxes. In addition, we identify candidates for cool
	(\$F\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{p\}\} {\textless} 20 {\textbackslash}mathrm\{F\_{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$) inflated Jupiters, present
	a revised list of habitable zone candidates, and find that the ages of

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that atmospheric mass-loss powered by the 
cooling luminosity of a planet's core can explain the observed radius
valley separating super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, even without
photoevaporation. In this work, we investigate the dependence of this
core-powered mass-loss mechanism on stellar mass (M*),
metallicity (Z*), and age (τ*). Without making
any changes to the underlying planet population, we find that the
core-powered mass-loss model yields a shift in the radius valley to
larger planet sizes around more massive stars with a slope given by dlog
Rp/dlog M* ≃ 0.35, in agreement with
observations. To first order, this slope is driven by the dependence of
core-powered mass-loss on the bolometric luminosity of the host star and
is given by dlog Rp/dlog M* ≃ (3α -
2)/36 ≃ 0.33, where (L*/L⊙) =
(M*/M⊙)α is the stellar
mass-luminosity relation and α ≃ 4.6 for the CKS data set. We
therefore find, in contrast to photoevaporation models, no evidence for
a linear correlation between planet and stellar mass, but cannot rule it
out either. In addition, we show that the location of the radius valley
is, to first order, independent of stellar age and metallicity. Since
core-powered mass-loss proceeds over Gyr time-scales, the abundance of
super-Earths relative to sub-Neptunes increases with age but decreases
with stellar metallicity. Finally, due to the dependence of the
envelope's cooling time-scale on metallicity, we find that the radii of
sub-Neptunes increase with metallicity and decrease with age with slopes
given by dlog Rp/dlog Z* ≃ 0.1 and dlog
Rp/dlog τ* ≃ -0.1, respectively. We
conclude with a series of observational tests that can differentiate
between core-powered mass-loss and photoevaporation models.},

short-period exoplanets with a paucity in their occurrence, a radius
`valley', around 1.5-2.0 R⊕. In this work, we
investigate the effect of a planet's own cooling luminosity on its
thermal evolution and atmospheric mass loss (core-powered mass-loss) and
determine its observational consequences for the radius distribution of
small, close-in exoplanets. Using simple analytical descriptions and
numerical simulations, we demonstrate that planetary evolution based on
the core-powered mass-loss mechanism alone (i.e. without any
photoevaporation) can produce the observed valley in the radius
distribution. Our results match the valley's location, shape and slope
in planet radius-orbital period parameter space, and the relative
magnitudes of the planet occurrence rate above and below the valley. We
find that the slope of the valley is, to first order, dictated by the
atmospheric mass-loss time-scale at the Bondi radius and given by d
logRp/d logP ≃ 1/(3(1 - β)) that evaluates to -0.11
for β ≃ 4, where Mc/M⊕ =
(Rc/R⊕)β(ρc∗/ρ⊕)β/3
is the mass-radius relation of the core. This choice for β yields
good agreement with observations and attests to the significance of
internal compression for massive planetary cores. We further find that
the location of the valley scales as ρ \_c*{\textasciicircum}\{-4/9\} and that the
observed planet population must have predominantly rocky cores with
typical water-ice fractions of less than \{∼ \} 20\{\{ per cent\}\}.
Furthermore, we show that the relative magnitude of the planet
occurrence rate above and below the valley is sensitive to the details
of the planet-mass distribution but that the location of the valley is
not.},

We review the performances of this instrument, describe its operating conditions, and present results from the analysis of observations obtained during its first three years (2010-2012) of operation, before its repatriation in 2014. During this time, we observed a total of 22 stellar fields (1° × 1° field of view). Each field, in which we measured stars up
to magnitude R = 18 mag, was observed continuously during ∼7 to
∼30 d. More than 200 000 frames were recorded and 310 000 stars
processed, using an implementation of the optimal image subtraction photometry algorithm. We found 43 planetary transit candidates. 20 of these candidates were observed using spectroscopic follow-ups including four targets classified as good planet candidates. Our results
demonstrate that accurate near-continuous photometric observations are achievable from the Concordia station at Dome C in Antarctica, even if we were not able to reach the nominal photometric precision of the instrument. We conducted a correlation analysis between the rms noise and a large number of external parameters and found that source of the ∼1 mmag correlated noise is not obvious and does not depend on a single parameter. However, our analysis provided some hints and guidance to increase the photometric accuracy of the instrument. These
improvements should equip any future telescope operating in Antarctica.},

	abstract = {{\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: The Antarctica Search for Transiting ExoPlanets (ASTEP) program was originally aimed at probing the quality of the Dome C, Antarctica for the discovery and characterization of exoplanets by photometry. In the first year of operation of the 40 cm ASTEP 400 telescope (austral winter 2010), we targeted the known transiting planet WASP-19b in order to try to detect its secondary transits in the visible. This is made possible by the excellent sub-millimagnitude precision of the binned data. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: The WASP-19 system was observed during 24 nights in May 2010. Once brought back from Antarctica, the data were processed using various methods, and the best results were with an implementation of the optimal image subtraction (OIS) algorithm. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The photometric variability level due to starspots is about 1.8\% (peak-to-peak), in line with the SuperWASP data from 2007 (1.4\%) and higher than in 2008 (0.07\%). We find a rotation period of WASP-19 of 10.7 ± 0.5 days, in agreement with the SuperWASP determination of 10.5 ± 0.2 days. Theoretical models show that this can only be explained if tidal dissipation in the star is weak, i.e. the tidal dissipation factor Q'{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}★{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&gt; 3×10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}7{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. Separately, we find evidence of a secondary eclipse of depth 390 ± 190 ppm with a 2.0σ significance, a phase that is consistent with a circular orbit and a 3\% false positive probability. Given the wavelength range of the observations (420 to 950 nm), the secondary transit depth translates into a day-side brightness temperature of 2690{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-220{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+150{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} K, in line with measurements in the z' and K bands. The day-side emission observed in the visible could be due either to thermal emission of an extremely hot day side with very little redistribution of heat to the night side or to direct reflection of stellar light with a maximum geometrical albedo A{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}g{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.27 ± 0.13. We also report a low-frequency oscillation in phase at the planet orbital period, but with a lower limit amplitude that could not be attributed to the planet phase alone and that was possibly contaminated with residual lightcurve trends. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: This first evidence of a secondary eclipse in the visible from the ground demonstrates the high potential of Dome C, Antarctica, for continuous photometric observations of stars with exoplanets. These continuous observations are required to understand star-planet interactions and the dynamical properties of exoplanetary atmospheres.

	abstract = {Context. Dome C in Antarctica is a promising site for photometric observations thanks to the continuous night during the Antarctic winter and favorable weather conditions. Aims.We developed instruments to assess the quality of this site for photometry in the visible and to detect and characterize variable objects through the Antarctic Search for Transiting ExoPlanets (ASTEP) project. Methods: Here, we present the full analysis of four winters of data collected with ASTEP South, a 10 cm refractor pointing continuously toward the celestial south pole. We improved the instrument over the years and developed specific data reduction methods. Results: We achieved nearly continuous observations over the winters. We measure an average sky background of 20 mag arcsec-2 in the 579-642 nm bandpass. We built the lightcurves of 6000 stars and developed a model to infer the photometric quality of Dome C from the lightcurves themselves. The weather is photometric 67.1 ± 4.2\% of the time and veiled 21.8
± 2.0\% of the time. The remaining time corresponds to poor
quality data or winter storms. We analyzed the lightcurves of σ
Oct and HD 184465 and find that the amplitude of their main frequency varies by a factor of 3.5 and 6.7 over the four years, respectively. We also identify 34 new variable stars and eight new eclipsing binaries with periods ranging from 0.17 to 81 days. Conclusion. The phase coverage that we achieved with ASTEP South is exceptional for a
ground-based instrument and the data quality enables the detection and study of variable objects. These results demonstrate the high quality of Dome C for photometry in the visible and for time series observations in general.

This suggests a great

	abstract = {Magnetic fields are hypothesized to inflate the radii of low-mass 
stars—defined as less massive than 0.8 M
⊙—in detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs). We
investigate this hypothesis using the recently introduced magnetic
Dartmouth stellar evolution code. In particular, we focus on stars
thought to have a radiative core and convective outer envelope by
studying in detail three individual DEBs: UV Psc, YY Gem, and CU Cnc.
Our results suggest that the stabilization of thermal convection by a
magnetic field is a plausible explanation for the observed model-radius
discrepancies. However, surface magnetic field strengths required by the
models are significantly stronger than those estimated from observed
coronal X-ray emission. Agreement between model predicted surface
magnetic field strengths and those inferred from X-ray observations can
be found by assuming that the magnetic field sources its energy from
convection. This approach makes the transport of heat by convection less
efficient and is akin to reduced convective mixing length methods used
in other studies. Predictions for the metallicity and magnetic field
strengths of the aforementioned systems are reported. We also develop an
expression relating a reduction in the convective mixing length to a
magnetic field strength in units of the equipartition value. Our results
are compared with those from previous investigations to incorporate
magnetic fields to explain the low-mass DEB radius inflation. Finally,
we explore how the effects of magnetic fields might affect mass
determinations using asteroseismic data and the implication of magnetic
fields on exoplanet studies.},

magnitude as the luminosity index and B-V as the color index. This peculiarity has been known for 40 years but has gone unexplained and mostly ignored. When compared to Praesepe members, the Pleiades K dwarfs again are subluminous (or blue) in a color-magnitude diagram using B-V as the color index. However, using V-I as the color index, stars in the two clusters are coincident to MV{\textasciitilde}10 using V-K as the color index, Pleiades late K and M stars fall above the main-sequence locus defined by Praesepe members. We believe that the anomalous spectral energy distributions for the Pleiades K dwarfs, as compared to older clusters, are a consequence of rapid stellar rotation and may be primarily due to spottedness. If so, the required areal filling factor for the cool component has to be very large ({\textgreater}=50\%). Weak-lined T Tauri stars have similar color anomalies, and we suspect that this is a common feature of all very young K dwarfs (spectral type {\textgreater}K3). The peculiar spectral energy distribution needs to be considered in deriving accurate pre-main-sequence isochrone-fitting ages for clusters like the Pleiades, since the age derived will depend on the temperature index used.

will be detected by forthcoming satellite missions), the velocity
anomaly produced by the RM effect can be much larger than the orbital
velocity of the star. For a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone of
a Sunlike star found by the Kepler mission, it will be difficult to use
the RM effect to confirm transits with current instruments, but it still
may be easier than measuring the spectroscopic orbit.},

	abstract = {AU Mic{\textasciitilde}b is a Neptune size planet on a 8.47-day orbit around the nearest pre-main sequence (\${\textbackslash}sim\$20 Myr) star to the Sun, the bright (V=8.81) M dwarf AU Mic. The planet was preliminary detected in Doppler radial velocity time series and recently confirmed to be transiting with data from the TESS mission. AU Mic{\textasciitilde}b is likely to be cooling and contracting and might be accompanied by a second, more massive planet, in an outer orbit. Here, we present the observations of the transit of AU Mic{\textasciitilde}b using ESPRESSO on the VLT. We obtained a high-resolution time series of spectra to measure the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and constrain the spin-orbit alignment of the star and planet, and simultaneously attempt to retrieve the planet's atmospheric transmission spectrum. These observations allow us to study for the first time the early phases of the dynamical evolution of young systems. We apply different methodologies to derive the spin-orbit angle of AU Mic{\textasciitilde}b, and all of them retrieve values consistent with the planet being aligned with the rotation plane of the star. We determine a conservative spin-orbit angle \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ value of \$-2.96{\textasciicircum}\{+10.44\}\_\{-10.30\}\$, indicative that the formation and migration of the planets of the AU Mic system occurred within the disk. Unfortunately, and despite the large SNR of our measurements, the degree of stellar activity prevented us from detecting any features from the planetary atmosphere. In fact, our results suggest that transmission spectroscopy for recently formed planets around active young stars is going to remain very challenging, if at all possible, for the near future.},

The planet was recently discovered from preliminary analysis of radial velocity observations and confirmed to be transiting its host star from photometric data from the NASA's {\textbackslash}textit\{TESS\} mission. We obtained radial velocity measurements of the Rossiter--McLaughlin effect for AU{\textbackslash},Mic{\textbackslash},b over the course of two partially observable transits and one full transit from high-resolution spectroscopic observations made with the \{{\textbackslash}textsc\{Minerva\}\}-Australis telescope array.

This measurement is in excellent agreement with observations carried out on other instruments around the same time. AU{\textbackslash},Mic is the youngest exoplanetary system for which the projected spin-orbit angle has been measured, making it a key data point in the study of the formation and migration of exoplanets -- particularly given that the system is also host to a bright debris disk. Given that we find this system (star, planet, and disk) to be in near spin-orbit alignment, it seems likely that the planet formed farther out beyond the ice-line and then migrated inwards to its current location via quiescent migration through the disk, rather than through mechanisms that would excite the inclination of the planet's orbit.},

AU Mic possesses a relatively rare and spatially resolved3 edge-on debris disk extending from about 35 to 210 astronomical units from the star, and with clumps exhibiting non-Keplerian motion. Detection of newly formed planets around such a star is challenged by the presence of spots, plage, flares and other manifestations of magnetic activity on the star. Here we report observations of a planet transiting AU Mic. The transiting planet, AU Mic b, has an orbital period of 8.46 days, an orbital distance of 0.07 astronomical units, a radius of 0.4 Jupiter radii, and a mass of less than 0.18 Jupiter masses at 3 sigma confidence.

	abstract = {We present empirical measurements of the radii of 116 stars that host transiting planets. These radii are determined using only direct observables—the bolometric flux at Earth, the effective temperature, and the parallax provided by the Gaia first data release—and thus are virtually model independent, with extinction being the only free parameter. We also determine each star’s mass using our newly determined radius and the stellar density, a virtually model independent quantity itself from previously published transit analyses. These stellar radii and masses are in turn used to redetermine the transiting-planet radii and masses, again using only direct observables. The median uncertainties on the stellar radii and masses are 8\% and 30\%, respectively, and the resulting uncertainties on the planet radii and masses are 9\% and 22\%, respectively. These accuracies are generally larger than previously published model-dependent precisions of 5\% and 6\% on the planet radii and masses, respectively, but the newly determined values are purely empirical. We additionally report radii for 242 stars hosting radial-velocity (non-transiting) planets, with a median achieved accuracy of ≈2\%. Using our empirical stellar masses we verify that the majority of putative “retired A stars” in the sample are indeed more massive than ̃1.2 \{M\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉ {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Most importantly, the bolometric fluxes and angular radii reported here for a total of 498 planet host stars—with median accuracies of 1.7\% and 1.8\%, respectively—serve as a fundamental data set to permit the re-determination of transiting-planet radii and masses with the Gaia second data release to ≈3\% and ≈5\% accuracy, better than currently published precisions, and determined in an entirely empirical fashion.},

	abstract = {Context. The young associations offer us one of the best opportunities to study the properties of young stellar and substellar objects and to directly image planets thanks to their proximity (\&lt;200 pc) and age (≈5-150 Myr). However, many previous works have been limited to identifying the brighter, more active members (≈1 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) owing to photometric survey sensitivities limiting the detections of lower mass objects. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We search the field of view of 542 previously identified members of the young associations to identify wide or extremely wide (1000-100 000 au in physical separation) companions. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We combined 2MASS near-infrared photometry (J, H, K) with proper motion values (from UCAC4, PPMXL, NOMAD) to identify companions in the field of view of known members. We collated further photometry and spectroscopy from the literature and conducted our own high-resolution spectroscopic observations for a subsample of candidate members. This complementary information allowed us to assess the efficiency of our method. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We identified 84 targets (45: 0.2-1.3 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, 17: 0.08-0.2 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, 22: \&lt;0.08 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) in our analysis, ten of which have been identified from spectroscopic analysis in previous young association works. For 33 of these 84, we were able to further assess their membership using a variety of properties (X-ray emission, UV excess, H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}α{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, lithium and K I equivalent widths, radial velocities, and CaH indices). We derive a success rate of 76-88\% for this technique based on the consistency of these properties. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Once confirmed, the targets identified in this work would significantly improve our knowledge of the lower mass end of the young associations. Additionally, these targets would make an ideal new sample for the identification and study of planets around nearby young stars. Given the predicted substellar mass of the majority of these new candidate members and their proximity, high-contrast imaging techniques would facilitate the search for new low-mass planets. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on FEROS observations obtained during CNTAC programme CN2015B-9 and observations made with the HERMES spectrograph mounted on the 1.2 m Mercator Telescope at the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias.Full Table 4 (Appendix E) is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/590/A13"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/590/A13{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Determining the sequence of events in the formation of stars and planetary systems and their timescales is essential for understanding those processes, yet establishing ages is fundamentally difficult because we lack direct indicators. In this review we discuss the age challenge for young stars, specifically those less than {\textasciitilde}100 m.y. old. Most age determination methods that we discuss are primarily applicable to groups of stars but can be used to estimate the age of individual objects. A reliable age scale is established above 20 m.y. from measurement of the lithium depletion boundary (LDB) in young clusters, and consistency is shown between these ages and those from the upper-main-sequence (UMS) and main-sequence (MS) turn-off — if modest core convection and rotation is included in the models of higher-mass stars. Other available methods for age estimation include the kinematics of young groups, placing stars in Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams (HRDs), pulsations and seismology, surface gravity measurement, rotation and activity, and Li abundance. We review each of these methods and present known strengths and weaknesses. Below {\textasciitilde}20 m.y., both model-dependent and observational uncertainties grow, the situation is confused by the possibility of age spreads, and no reliable absolute ages yet exist. The lack of absolute age calibration below 20 m.y. should be born in mind when considering the lifetimes of protostellar phases and circumstellar material.},

	abstract = {Aims: Many topical astrophysical research areas, such as the 
properties of planet host stars, the nature of the progenitors of
different types of supernovae and gamma ray bursts, and the evolution of
galaxies, require complete and homogeneous sets of stellar models at
different metallicities in order to be studied during the whole of
cosmic history. We present here a first set of models for solar
metallicity, where the effects of rotation are accounted for in a
homogeneous way. Methods: We computed a grid of 48 different
stellar evolutionary tracks, both rotating and non-rotating, at Z =
0.014, spanning a wide mass range from 0.8 to 120 M⊙. For
each of the stellar masses considered, electronic tables provide data
for 400 stages along the evolutionary track and at each stage, a set of
43 physical data are given. These grids thus provide an extensive and
detailed data basis for comparisons with the observations. The rotating
models start on the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) with a rotation rate
υini/υcrit = 0.4. The evolution is
computed until the end of the central carbon-burning phase, the early
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase, or the core helium-flash for,
respectively, the massive, intermediate, and both low and very low mass
stars. The initial abundances are those deduced by Asplund and
collaborators, which best fit the observed abundances of massive stars
in the solar neighbourhood. We update both the opacities and nuclear
reaction rates, and introduce new prescriptions for the mass-loss rates
as stars approach the Eddington and/or the critical velocity. We account
for both atomic diffusion and magnetic braking in our low-mass star
models. Results: The present rotating models provide a good
description of the average evolution of non-interacting stars. In
particular, they reproduce the observed main-sequence width, the
positions of the red giant and supergiant stars in the
Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram, the observed surface compositions and
rotational velocities. Very interestingly, the enhancement of the mass
loss during the red-supergiant stage, when the luminosity becomes

interesting consequences for the blue to red supergiant ratio, the
minimum mass for stars to become Wolf-Rayet stars, and the maximum

	abstract = {Context: A new reduction of the astrometric data as produced by the 
Hipparcos mission has been published, claiming that the accuracies for
nearly all stars brighter than magnitude Hp = 8 are improved, by up to a
factor 4, compared to the original catalogue. As correlations between
the underlying abscissa residuals have also been reduced by more than an
order of magnitude to an insignificant level, our ability to determine
reliable parallaxes and proper motions for open clusters should be
improved. Aims: The new Hipparcos astrometric catalogue is used
to derive mean parallax and proper motion estimates for 20 open
clusters. The HR-diagrams of the nearest clusters are compared and
combined to provide future input to sets of observational isochrones.
Methods: Three different methods are applied, according to the
proximity of the cluster, to compensate, where needed, for projection
effects, spread in position along the line of sight, and the internal
velocity dispersion of the cluster stars. Results: The new
parallaxes have accuracies between 2 and 2.5 times higher than what had
been derived from the original Hipparcos catalogue. At least two to
three groups of clusters, mostly of similar ages, are observed to each
occupy their own specific space in the HR diagram. A significant
discrepancy in distance moduli from those obtained with isochrone-based
main-sequence fitting remains, in particular for one of these groups,
containing the Pleiades, NGC 2516, and Blanco 1. The difference in
absolute magnitudes between this group and one containing the Hyades and
Praesepe clusters appears to be correlated with systematic differences
in the Strömgren Δ c0 index between those groups.
The same dependency has been known to exist for a long time, and is
again confirmed by the Hipparcos data, in variations in absolute
magnitudes for field stars of the same effective temperature. Conclusions: The positions of the cluster HR diagrams are consistent
within different groups of clusters shown for example by the
near-perfect alignment of the sequences for the Hyades and Praesepe, for
Coma Ber and UMa, and for the Pleiades, NGC 2516, and Blanco 1. The
groups are mutually consistent when systematic differences in Δ
c0 are taken into account, where the effect of these
differences on the absolute magnitudes has been calibrated using
field-star observations.},

	abstract = {We have obtained high-resolution, moderate signal-to-noise ratio spectra 
for approximately 80 candidate low-mass members of the nearby, very
young open clusters IC 2391 and IC 2602. Most of the stars observed are
confirmed as cluster members based on a combination of photometric and
spectroscopic criteria. We provide radial velocities, rotational
velocities, and Hα equivalent widths for these stars. From
comparison to theoretical pre-main-sequence (PMS) evolutionary
isochrones from D'Antona and Mazzitelli, we derive an estimated age of
the two clusters of {\textasciitilde}25 Myr. By contrast, the usually quoted upper
main-sequence turnoff age for the clusters is {\textasciitilde}35 Myr. We do not believe
that this provides evidence for noncoeval star formation within these
clusters, but rather that the best age estimate for them given the
uncertainties is {\textasciitilde}30 +/- 5 Myr. In principle, the scatter of stars about
the PMS isochrone provides a measure of the age spread among the
low-mass stars in these clusters; however, with the data presently
available, we are able to derive only a relatively uninteresting upper
limit for an age spread of order 20 Myr.

We compare the rotational velocity distribution for IC 2391/2602 to that
observed for the Pleiades. For the G dwarfs in the IC clusters, we
resolve rotation in all but one of the probable cluster members, and
thus except for inclination effects, our data provide the complete
distribution of rotational velocities for solar mass stars on their
arrival on the ZAMS. The projected rotational velocities (v sin i) of
the G dwarfs in the two IC clusters span the range from {\textasciitilde}8 to {\textasciitilde}200 km
s-1. Comparison of the distribution of rotational velocities
for the G dwarfs of the Pleiades and the IC clusters indicates that both
the slow and the rapid rotators lose of order half their angular
momentum during the first {\textasciitilde}35 Myr on the main sequence if they rotate as
solid bodies.

The low-mass stars in these two clusters exhibit a similar correlation
between rotation and coronal activity as is found in several other young
open clusters. That is, there is a large spread in coronal activity for
stars with v sin i {\textless} 25 km s-1, where we assume there is
an intrinsic link between increasing rotation and increasing activity
superimposed upon which are a variety of observational and physical
mechanisms that act to smear out this relation; above v sin i {\textasciitilde} 25 km
s-1, all of the low-mass stars have log
(LX/Lbol) {\textasciitilde} -3.0, the canonical ``saturation''
limit. Our measurements of the Hα equivalent widths are consistent
with a similar relationship holding for chromospheric activity. One and
possibly two of our spectra for M dwarf members of the IC clusters show
broad wings for the Hα profile, which we attribute to a flare
event or to microflares. Since spectra of a small sample of late-type M
dwarfs in the Pleiades also showed similarly broad Hα wings, this
suggests that flare frequencies for very young M dwarfs may be quite
high.},

A higher confidence subsample of ∼9200 PMS (and ∼1340 MS) members is also selected ({\textless}1\% contamination for the PMS), however this group is affected by larger (∼15\%) incompleteness. We separately classify stars in compact and diffuse populations. Most members belong to one of several kinematically distinct diffuse populations, whose ensemble clearly outlines the shape of the entire association. Upper Sco is the densest region of Sco OB2. It is characterized by a complex spatial and kinematical structure and has no global pattern of motion. Other dense subclusters are found in Lower Centaurus-Crux and in Upper Centaurus-Lupus; the richest example of the latter, which has been recently identified, is coincident with the group near V1062 Sco. Most of the clustered stars appear to be younger than the diffuse PMS population, suggesting star formation in small groups that rapidly disperse and are diluted, reaching space densities lower than field stars while keeping memory of their original kinematics. We also find that the open cluster IC 2602 has a similar dynamics to Sco OB2, and its PMS members are currently evaporating and forming a diffuse (size ∼10°) halo around its double-peaked core.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive census of the stellar content of the OB associations within 1 kpc from the Sun is presented, based on Hipparcos positions, proper motions, and parallaxes. It is a key part of a long-term project to study the formation, structure, and evolution of nearby young stellar groups and related star-forming regions. OB associations are unbound ``moving groups,'' which can be detected kinematically because of their small internal velocity dispersion. The nearby associations have a large extent on the sky, which traditionally has limited astrometric
membership determination to bright stars (V{\textless}{\textasciitilde}6 mag), with spectral types earlier than {\textasciitilde}B5. The Hipparcos measurements allow a major improvement in this situation. Moving groups are identified in the Hipparcos Catalog by combining de Bruijne's refurbished convergent point method with the ``Spaghetti method'' of Hoogerwerf \& Aguilar.
Astrometric members are listed for 12 young stellar groups, out to a distance of {\textasciitilde}650 pc. These are the three subgroups Upper Scorpius, Upper Centaurus Lupus, and Lower Centaurus Crux of Sco OB2, as well as Vel OB2, Tr 10, Col 121, Per OB2, alpha Persei (Per OB3), Cas-Tau, Lac OB1, Cep OB2, and a new group in Cepheus, designated as Cep OB6. The
selection procedure corrects the list of previously known astrometric and photometric B- and A-type members in these groups and identifies many new members, including a significant number of F stars, as well as evolved stars, e.g., the Wolf-Rayet stars gamma{\textasciicircum}2 Vel (WR 11) in Vel OB2 and EZ CMa (WR 6) in Col 121, and the classical Cepheid delta Cep in Cep OB6. Membership probabilities are given for all selected stars. Monte Carlo simulations are used to estimate the expected number of interloper field stars. In the nearest associations, notably in Sco OB2, the later-type members include T Tauri objects and other stars in the final pre-main-sequence phase. This provides a firm link between the classical high-mass stellar content and ongoing low-mass star formation. Detailed studies of these 12 groups, and their relation to the surrounding interstellar medium, will be presented elsewhere. Astrometric evidence for moving groups in the fields of R CrA, CMa OB1, Mon OB1, Ori OB1, Cam OB1, Cep OB3, Cep OB4, Cyg OB4, Cyg OB7, and Sct OB2, is inconclusive. OB associations do exist in many of these regions, but they are either at distances beyond {\textasciitilde}500 pc where the Hipparcos parallaxes are of limited use, or they have unfavorable kinematics, so that the group proper motion does not distinguish it from the field stars in the Galactic disk. The mean distances of the well-established groups are systematically smaller than the pre-Hipparcos photometric estimates. While part of this may be caused by the improved membership lists, a recalibration of the upper main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram may be called for. The mean motions display a systematic pattern, which is discussed in relation to the Gould Belt. Six of the 12 detected moving groups do not appear in the classical list of nearby OB associations. This is sometimes caused by the absence of O stars, but in other cases a previously known open cluster turns out to be (part of) an extended OB association. The number of unbound young stellar groups in the solar neighborhood may be significantly larger than thought
previously.},

The approach uses a per cadence modeling of the raw pixel data and then performs an aperture optimization based on signal-to-noise ratio and the Kepler Combined Differential Photometric Precision (CDPP), which is a measure of the noise over the duration of a reference transit signal. We have found the new apertures to be superior to the previous Kepler apertures. We can now also find a per cadence flux fraction in aperture and crowding metric. The new approach has also been proven to be robust at finding apertures in K2 data that help mitigate the larger motion-induced systematics in the photometry.

In the inner solar system, the planets’ orbits evolve chaotically, driven primarily by secular chaos. Mercury has a particularly chaotic orbit and is in danger of being lost within a few billion years. Just as secular chaos is reorganizing the solar system today, so it has likely helped organize it in the past. We suggest that extrasolar planetary systems are also organized to a large extent by secular chaos. A hot Jupiter could be the end state of a secularly chaotic planetary system reminiscent of the solar system. However, in the case of the hot Jupiter, the innermost planet was Jupiter (rather than Mercury) sized, and its chaotic evolution was terminated when it was tidally captured by its star. In this contribution, we review our recent work elucidating the physics of secular chaos and applying it to Mercury and to hot Jupiters. We also present results comparing the inclinations of hot Jupiters thus produced with observations.},

	abstract = {At least two arguments suggest that the orbits of a large fraction of binary stars and extrasolar planets shrank by 1-2 orders of magnitude after formation: (1) the physical radius of a star shrinks by a large factor from birth to the main sequence, yet many main-sequence stars have companions orbiting only a few stellar radii away, and (2) in current theories of planet formation, the region within {\textasciitilde}0.1 AU of a protostar is too hot and rarefied for a Jupiter-mass planet to form, yet many ``hot Jupiters'' are observed at such distances. We investigate orbital shrinkage by the combined effects of secular perturbations from a distant companion star (Kozai oscillations) and tidal friction. We integrate the relevant equations of motion to predict the distribution of orbital elements produced by this process. Binary stars with orbital periods of 0.1-10 days, with a median of {\textasciitilde}2 days, are produced from binaries with much longer periods (10 to {\textasciitilde}10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} days), consistent with observations indicating that most or all short-period binaries have distant companions (tertiaries). We also make two new testable predictions: (1) For periods between 3 and 10 days, the distribution of the mutual inclination between the inner binary and the tertiary orbit should peak strongly near 40° and 140°. (2) Extrasolar planets whose host stars have a distant binary companion may also undergo this process, in which case the orbit of the resulting hot Jupiter will typically be misaligned with the equator of its host star. This work is dedicated to the late Bohdan Paczyński, who inspired it.},

Based on the present understanding of planet formation via core accretion and oligarchic growth, we expect that giant planets often form in closely packed configurations. While the protoplanets are embedded in a protoplanetary gas disk, dissipation can prevent eccentricity growth and suppress instabilities from becoming manifest. However, once the disk dissipates, eccentricities can grow rapidly, leading to close encounters between planets. Strong planet-planet gravitational scattering could produce both high eccentricities and, after tidal circularization, very short period planets, as observed in the exoplanet population. We present new results for this scenario based on extensive dynamical integrations of systems containing three giant planets, both with and without residual gas disks. We assign the initial planetary masses and orbits in a realistic manner following the core accretion model of planet formation. We show that, with realistic initial conditions, planet-planet scattering can reproduce quite well the observed eccentricity distribution. Our results also make testable predictions for the orbital inclinations of short-period giant planets formed via strong planet scattering followed by tidal circularization.},

Analysis of systematic variations in the velocity of the star indicate
that the mass of the companion is approximately that of Jupiter, and
that it is travelling in a nearly circular orbit at a distance from the
star of 0.05 AU (about seven stellar radii). Here we show that, if the
companion is indeed a gas-giant planet, it is extremely unlikely to have
formed at its present location. We suggest instead that the planet
probably formed by gradual accretion of solids and capture of gas at a
much larger distance from the star ({\textasciitilde}5 AU), and that it subsequently
migrated inwards through interactions with the remnants of the
circumstellar disk. The planet's migration may have stopped in its
present orbit as a result of tidal interactions with the star, or
through truncation of the inner circumstellar disk by the stellar
magnetosphere.},

Early theoretical models predicted helium to be among the most readily detectable species in the atmospheres of exoplanets, especially in extended and escaping atmospheres. Searches for helium, however, have hitherto been unsuccessful. Here we report observations of helium on an exoplanet, at a confidence level of 4.5 standard deviations. We measured the near- infrared transmission spectrum of the warm gas giant WASP-107b and identified the narrow absorption feature of excited metastable helium at 10,833 angstroms. The amplitude of the feature, in transit depth, is 0.049 +/- 0.011 per cent in a bandpass of 98 angstroms, which is more than five times greater than what could be caused by nominal stellar chromospheric activity. This large absorption signal suggests that WASP-107b has an extended atmosphere that is eroding at a total rate of 10{\textasciicircum}10 to 3 x 10{\textasciicircum}11 grams per second (0.1-4 per cent of its total mass per billion years), and may have a comet-like tail of gas shaped by radiation pressure.},

We use similar HST/WFC3 observations to detect helium in the atmosphere of the hot Neptune HAT-P-11b at the \$4{\textbackslash}sigma\$ confidence level. We compare our observations to a grid of 1D models of hydrodynamic escape to constrain the thermospheric temperatures and mass loss rate. We find that our data are best fit by models with high mass loss rates of \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\} {\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}\$ - \$10{\textasciicircum}\{11\}\$ g s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. Although we do not detect the planetary wind directly, our data are consistent with the prediction that HAT-P-11b is experiencing hydrodynamic atmospheric escape. Nevertheless, the mass loss rate is low enough that the planet has only lost up to a few percent of its mass over its history, leaving its bulk composition largely unaffected. This matches the expectation from population statistics, which indicate that close-in planets with radii greater than 2 R\$\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ form and retain H/He-dominated atmospheres. We also confirm the independent detection of helium in HAT-P-11b obtained with the CARMENES instrument, making this the first exoplanet with the detection of the same signature of photoevaporation from both ground- and space-based facilities.},

Simulations of potential moon-forming impacts now achieve resolutions sufficient to study the production of bound debris. However, identifying impacts capable of yielding the Earth-Moon system has proved difficult. Previous works found that forming the Moon with an appropriate impact angular momentum required the impact to occur when the Earth was only about half formed, a more restrictive and problematic model than that originally envisaged. Here we report a class of impacts that yield an iron-poor Moon, as well as the current masses and angular momentum of the Earth-Moon system. This class of impacts involves a smaller-and thus more likely-object than previously considered viable, and suggests that the Moon formed near the very end of Earth's accumulation.},

	abstract = {The 182Hf- 182W systematics of meteoritic and 
planetary samples provide firm constraints on the chronology of the
accretion and earliest evolution of asteroids and terrestrial planets
and lead to the following succession and duration of events in the
earliest solar system. Formation of Ca,Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) at
4568.3 ± 0.7 Ma was followed by the accretion and differentiation
of the parent bodies of some magmatic iron meteorites within less than
∼1 Myr. Chondrules from H chondrites formed 1.7 ± 0.7 Myr
after CAIs, about contemporaneously with chondrules from L and LL
chondrites as shown by their 26Al- 26Mg ages. Some
magmatism on the parent bodies of angrites, eucrites, and mesosiderites
started as soon as ∼3 Myr after CAI formation and may have continued
until ∼10 Myr. A similar timescale is obtained for the
high-temperature metamorphic evolution of the H chondrite parent body.
Thermal modeling combined with these age constraints reveals that the
different thermal histories of meteorite parent bodies primarily reflect
their initial abundance of 26Al, which is determined by their
accretion age. Impact-related processes were important in the subsequent
evolution of asteroids but do not appear to have induced large-scale
melting. For instance, Hf-W ages for eucrite metals postdate CAI
formation by ∼20 Myr and may reflect impact-triggered thermal
metamorphism in the crust of the eucrite parent body. Likewise, the Hf-W
systematics of some non-magmatic iron meteorites were modified by
impact-related processes but the timing of this event(s) remains poorly
constrained. The strong fractionation of lithophile Hf from siderophile
W during core formation makes the Hf-W system an ideal chronometer for
this major differentiation event. However, for larger planets such as
the terrestrial planets the calculated Hf-W ages are particularly
sensitive to the occurrence of large impacts, the degree to which
impactor cores re-equilibrated with the target mantle during large
collisions, and changes in the metal-silicate partition coefficients of
W due to changing fO 2 in differentiating planetary bodies.
Calculated core formation ages for Mars range from 0 to 20 Myr after CAI
formation and currently cannot distinguish between scenarios where Mars
formed by runaway growth and where its formation was more protracted.
Tungsten model ages for core formation in Earth range from ∼30 Myr
to {\textgreater}100 Myr after CAIs and hence do not provide a unique age for the
formation of Earth. However, the identical 182W/
184W ratios of the lunar and terrestrial mantles provide
powerful evidence that the Moon-forming giant impact and the final stage
of Earth's core formation occurred after extinction of 182Hf
(i.e., more than ∼50 Myr after CAIs), unless the Hf/W ratios of the
bulk silicate Moon and Earth are identical to within less than ∼10\%.
Furthermore, the identical 182W/ 184W of the lunar
and terrestrial mantles is difficult to explain unless either the Moon
consists predominantly of terrestrial material or the W in the
proto-lunar magma disk isotopically equilibrated with the Earth's
mantle. Hafnium-tungsten chronometry also provides constraints on the
duration of magma ocean solidification in terrestrial planets.
Variations in the 182W/ 184W ratios of martian
meteorites reflect an early differentiation of the martian mantle during
the effective lifetime of 182Hf. In contrast, no
182W variations exist in the lunar mantle, demonstrating
magma ocean solidification later than ∼60 Myr, in agreement with
147Sm- 143Nd ages for ferroan anorthosites. The
Moon-forming giant impact most likely erased any evidence of a prior
differentiation of Earth's mantle, consistent with a 146Sm-
142Nd age of 50-200 Myr for the earliest differentiation of
Earth's mantle. However, the Hf-W chronology of the formation of Earth's
core and the Moon-forming impact is difficult to reconcile with the
preservation of 146Sm- 142Nd evidence for an early
({\textless}30 Myr after CAIs) differentiation of a chondritic Earth's mantle.
Instead, the combined 182W- 142Nd evidence
suggests that bulk Earth may have superchondritic Sm/Nd and Hf/W ratios,
in which case formation of its core must have terminated more than
∼42 Myr after formation of CAIs, consistent with the Hf-W age for
the formation of the Moon.},

	abstract = {During silicate melting on Earth, W is one of the most incompatible trace elements, similar to Th, Ba or U. As W is also moderately
siderophile during metal segregation, ratios of W and the lithophile Th and U in silicate rocks have therefore been used to constrain the W abundance of the Earth's mantle and the Hf-W age of core formation. This study presents high-precision W concentration data obtained by isotope dilution for samples covering important silicate reservoirs on Earth. The data reveal significant fractionations of W from other highly incompatible lithophile elements such as Th, U, and Ta. Many arc lavas exhibit a selective enrichment of W relative to Th, U, and Nb-Ta, reflecting W enrichment in the sub-arc mantle via fluid-like components derived from subducting plates. In contrast, during enrichment by melt-like subduction components, W is generally slightly depleted relative to Th and U, but is still enriched relative to Ta. Hence, all arc rocks and the continental crust exhibit uniformly low Ta/W (ca. 1), whereas W/Th and W/U may show opposite fractionation trends, depending on the role of fluid- and melt-like subduction components. Further high-precision W data for OIBs and MORBs reveal a systematic depletion of W in both rock types relative to other HFSE, resulting in high Ta/W that are complementary to the low Ta/W observed in arc rocks and the continental crust. Similar to previous interpretations based on Nb/U and Ce/Pb systematics, our Ta/W data confirm a depletion of the depleted upper mantle (DM) in fluid mobile elements relative to the primitive mantle (PRIMA). The abundance of W in the depleted upper mantle relative to other immobile and highly incompatible elements such as Nb and Ta is therefore not representative of the bulk silicate Earth. Based on mass balance calculations using Ta-W systematics in the major silicate reservoirs, the W abundance of the Earth's primitive mantle can be constrained to 12 ppb, resulting in revised ratios of W-U and W-Th of 0.53 and 0.14, respectively. The newly constrained Hf-W ratio of the silicate Earth is 25.8, significantly higher than previously estimated (18.7) and overlaps within error the Hf-W ratio proposed for the Moon (ca. 24.9). The 182Hf- 182W model age for the formation of the Earth's core that is inferred from the 182W abundance and the Hf/W of the silicate Earth is therefore younger than previously calculated, by up to 5 Myrs after solar system formation depending on the accretion models used. The similar Hf/W ratios and 182W compositions of the Earth and the silicate Moon suggest a strong link between the Moon forming giant impact and final
metal-silicate equilibration on the Earth.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial planets are thought to have formed through collisions between large planetary embryos of diameter {\textasciitilde}1,000-5,000km. For Earth, the last of these collisions involved an impact by a Mars-size embryo that formed the Moon 50-150million years (Myr) after the birth of the Solar System. Although model simulations of the growth of terrestrial planets can reproduce the mass and dynamical parameters of the Earth and Venus, they fall short of explaining the small size of Mars. One possibility is that Mars was a planetary embryo that escaped collision and merging with other embryos. To assess this idea, it is crucial to know Mars' accretion timescale, which can be investigated using the 182Hf-182W decay system in
shergottite-nakhlite-chassignite meteorites. Nevertheless, this
timescale remains poorly constrained owing to a large uncertainty associated with the Hf/W ratio of the Martian mantle and as a result, contradicting timescales have been reported that range between 0 and 15Myr (refs 6-10). Here we show that Mars accreted very rapidly and reached about half of its present size in only Myr or less, which is consistent with a stranded planetary embryo origin. We have found a well-defined correlation between the Th/Hf and
176Hf/177Hf ratios in chondrites that reflects remobilization of Lu and Th during parent-body processes. Using this relationship, we estimate the Hf/W ratio in Mars' mantle to be
3.51+/-0.45. This value is much more precise than previous estimates, which ranged between 2.6 and 5.0 (ref. 6), and lifts the large
uncertainty that plagued previous estimates of the age of Mars. Our results also demonstrate that Mars grew before dissipation of the nebular gas when {\textasciitilde}100-km planetesimals, such as the parent bodies of chondrites, were still being formed. Mars' accretion occurred early enough to allow establishment of a magma ocean powered by decay of 26Al.},

In this brief review, I survey the literature related to ground-based and Spitzer-based infrared (IR) studies of young stellar clusters, with particular emphasis on tracing the evolution of primordial (``protoplanetary'') disks through
spectroscopic and photometric diagnostics. The available data
demonstrate that the fraction of young stars with optically thick primordial disks and/or those which show spectroscopic evidence for accretion appears to approximately follow an exponential decay with characteristic time {\textasciitilde}2.5 Myr (half-life {\textasciitilde}1.7 Myr). Large IR surveys of {\textasciitilde}2-5 Myr-old stellar samples show that there is real cluster-by-cluster scatter in the observed disk fractions as a function of age. Recent Spitzer surveys have found convincing evidence that disk evolution varies by stellar mass and environment (binarity, proximity to massive stars, and cluster density). Perhaps most significantly for
understanding the planeticity of stars, the disk fraction decay
timescale appears to vary by stellar mass, ranging from {\textasciitilde}1 Myr for {\textgreater}1.3 Msolar stars to {\textasciitilde}3 Myr for {\textless}0.08 Msolar brown dwarfs. The exponential decay function may provide a useful empirical formalism for estimating very rough ages for YSO populations and for modeling the effects of disk-locking on the angular momentum of young stars.},

	abstract = {New numerical simulations of the formation of the giant planets are presented, in which for the first time both the gas and planetesimal accretion rates are calculated in a self-consistent, interactive fashion. The simulations combine three elements: (1) three-body
accretion cross sections of solids onto an isolated planetary embryo, (2) a stellar evolution code for the planet's gaseous envelope, and (3) a planetesimal dissolution code within the envelope, used to evaluate the planet's effective capture radius and the energy deposition profile of accreted material. Major assumptions include: The planet is embedded in a disk of gas and small planetesimals with locally uniform initial surface mass density, and planetesimals are not allowed to migrate into or out of the planet's feeding zone.

All simulations are characterized by three major phases. During the first phase, the planet's mass consists primarily of solid material. The planetesimal accretion rate, which dominates that of gas, rapidly increases owing to runaway accretion, then decreases as the planet's feeding zone is depleted. During the second phase, both solid and gas accretion rates are small and nearly independent of time. The third phase, marked by runaway gas accretion, starts when the solid and gas masses are about equal. It is engendered by a strong positive feedback on the gas accretion rates, driven by the rapid contraction of the gaseous envelope and the rapid expansion of the outer boundary, which depends on the planet's total mass. The overall evolutionary time scale is generally determined by the length of the second phase.

The actual rates at which the giant planets accreted small planetesimals is probably intermediate between the constant rates assumed in most previous studies and the highly variable rates used here. Within the context of the adopted model of planetesimal accretion, the joint constraints of the time scale for dissipation of the solar nebula and the current high-Zmasses of the giant planets lead to estimates of the initial surface density (σinit) of planetesimals in the outer region of the solar nebula. The results show that
σinit≈ 10 g cm-2near Jupiter's orbit and
that σinit∝a-2, whereais the distance
from the Sun. These values are a factor of 3 to 4 times as high as that of the "minimum-mass" solar nebula at Jupiter's distance and a factor of 2 to 3 times as high at Saturn's distance. The estimates for the formation time of Jupiter and Saturn are 1 to 10 million years, whereas those for Uranus fall in the range 2 to 16 million years. These
estimates follow from the properties of our Solar System and do not necessarily apply to giant planets in other planetary systems.},

properties including mass, size, structure, and composition; and follow their varied evolutionary pathways.

Although this is reasonably well understood for the regions of the disk beyond about 1 AU, the structure of these disks inward of 1 AU remains a puzzle. This is partly because it is very difficult to spatially resolve these regions with current telescopes. But it is also because the physics of this region, where the disk becomes so hot that the dust starts to evaporate, is poorly understood. With infrared interferometry it has become possible in recent years to directly spatially resolve the inner 1 AU of
protoplanetary disks, albeit in a somewhat limited way. These
observations have partly confirmed current models of these regions, but also posed new questions and puzzles. Moreover, it has turned out that the numerical modeling of these regions is extremely challenging. In this review, we give a rough overview of the history and recent

Increasingly, new planet discoveries are being announced with a measurement of one of these quantities, but not both. This has led to a growing need to forecast the missing quantity using the other, especially when predicting the detectability of certain follow-up observations. We present an unbiased forecasting model built upon a probabilistic mass–radius relation conditioned on a sample of 316 well-constrained objects. Our publicly available code, Forecaster, accounts for observational errors, hyper-parameter uncertainties, and the intrinsic dispersions observed in the calibration sample. By conditioning our model on a sample spanning dwarf planets to late-type stars, Forecaster can predict the mass (or radius) from the radius (or mass) for objects covering nine orders of magnitude in mass. Classification is naturally performed by our model, which uses four classes we label as Terran worlds, Neptunian worlds, Jovian worlds, and stars. Our classification identifies dwarf planets as merely low-mass Terrans (like the Earth) and brown dwarfs as merely high-mass Jovians (like Jupiter). We detect a transition in the mass–radius relation at M⊕, which we associate with the divide between solid, Terran worlds and Neptunian worlds. This independent analysis adds further weight to the emerging consensus that rocky super-Earths represent a narrower region of parameter space than originally thought. Effectively, then, the Earth is the super-Earth we have been looking for.},

New observational aspects of this work include surveys for (1) very close companions with long-baseline interferometry at the CHARA Array, (2) close companions with speckle interferometry, and (3) wide proper motion companions identified by blinking multi-epoch archival images. In addition, we include the results from extensive radial-velocity monitoring programs and evaluate companion information from various catalogs. The overall observed fractions of single, double, triple, and higher order systems are 56\% {\textbackslash}pm 2\%, 33\% {\textbackslash}pm 2\%, 8\% {\textbackslash}pm 1\%, and 3\% {\textbackslash}pm 1\%, respectively, counting all confirmed stellar and brown dwarf companions. Our completeness analysis indicates that only a few undiscovered companions remain in this well-studied sample, implying that the majority (54\% {\textbackslash}pm 2\%) of solar-type stars are single, in contrast to the results of prior multiplicity studies. The orbital-period distribution of companions is unimodal and roughly log-normal with a peak of about 300 years. The period-eccentricity relation shows a roughly flat distribution beyond the expected circularization for periods below 12 days. The mass-ratio distribution shows a preference for like-mass pairs, which occur more frequently in relatively close pairs. The fraction of planet hosts among single, binary, and multiple systems are statistically indistinguishable, suggesting that planets are as likely to form around single stars as they are around components of binary or multiple systems with sufficiently wide separations.},

are incomplete beyond several AU. At larger star-planet separations,
direct planet detection through high-contrast imaging has proven
successful, but this technique is sensitive only to young planets and
characterization relies upon theoretical evolution models. Here we
demonstrate that radial velocity measurements and high-contrast imaging
can be combined to overcome these issues. The presence of widely
separated companions can be deduced by identifying an acceleration
(long-term trend) in the radial velocity of a star. By obtaining high
spatial resolution follow-up imaging observations, we rule out scenarios
in which such accelerations are caused by stellar binary companions with
high statistical confidence. We report results from an analysis of
Doppler measurements of a sample of 111 M-dwarf stars with a median of
29 radial velocity observations over a median time baseline of 11.8 yr.
By targeting stars that exhibit a radial velocity acceleration ("trend")
with adaptive optics imaging, we determine that 6.5\% ± 3.0\% of
M-dwarf stars host one or more massive companions with 1 {\textless}
m/MJ {\textless} 13 and 0 {\textless} a {\textless} 20 AU. These results are lower
than analyses of the planet occurrence rate around higher-mass stars. We
find the giant planet occurrence rate is described by a double power law
in stellar mass M and metallicity F ≡ [Fe/H] such that f(M,F) =
0.039{\textasciicircum}\{+0.056\}\_\{-0.028\} M{\textasciicircum}\{0.8{\textasciicircum}\{+1.1\}\_\{-0.9\}\} 10{\textasciicircum}\{(3.8 +/- 1.2)F\}. Our
results are consistent with gravitational microlensing measurements of

The host star is a visual binary, and our follow-up observations demonstrate that the planet orbits the G6V primary component, DS Tuc A (HD 222259A, TIC 410214986). We first identified transits using photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS; alerted as TOI 200.01). We validated the planet and improved the stellar parameters using a suite of new and archival data, including spectra from Southern Astrophysical Research/Goodman, South African Extremely Large Telescope/High Resolution Spectrograph and Las Cumbres Observatories/Network of Robotic Echelle Spectrographs; transit photometry from Spitzer; and deep adaptive optics imaging from Gemini/Gemini Planet Imager. No additional stellar or planetary signals are seen in the data. We measured the planetary parameters by simultaneously modeling the photometry with a transit model and a Gaussian process to account for stellar variability. We determined that the planetary radius is 5.70 ± 0.17 R ⊕ and that the orbital period is 8.1 days. The inclination angles of the host star’s spin axis, the planet’s orbital axis, and the visual binary’s orbital axis are aligned within 15° to within the uncertainties of the relevant data.

	abstract = {Exoplanets can evolve significantly between birth and maturity as their atmospheres, orbits, and structures are shaped by their environment. Young planets (\${\textless}\$1 Gyr) offer the opportunity to probe these sculpting processes. However, most of the known young planets orbit prohibitively faint stars. We present the discovery of two planets transiting HD 63433 (TOI 1726, TIC 130181866), a young Sun-like (\$M\_*=0.99{\textbackslash}pm0.03\$) star. Through kinematics, lithium abundance, and rotation, we confirm that HD 63433 is a member of the Ursa Major moving group (\${\textbackslash}tau=414{\textbackslash}pm23\$ Myr). Based on the TESS light curve and updated stellar parameters, the planet radii are \$2.15{\textbackslash}pm0.10R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ and \$2.67{\textbackslash}pm0.12R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$, the orbital periods are 7.11 and 20.55 days, and the orbital eccentricities are lower than abut 0.2. Using HARPS-N velocities, we measure the Rossiter-McLaughlin signal of the inner planet, demonstrating the orbit is prograde. Since the host star is bright (V=6.9), both planets are amenable to transmission spectroscopy, radial velocity measurements of their masses, and more precise determination of the stellar obliquity. This system is therefore poised to play an important role in our understanding of planetary system evolution in the first billion years after formation.},

	abstract = {A large fraction of the smallest transiting planet candidates discovered 
by the Kepler and CoRoT space missions cannot be confirmed by a
dynamical measurement of the mass using currently available observing
facilities. To establish their planetary nature, the concept of planet
validation has been advanced. This technique compares the probability of
the planetary hypothesis against that of all reasonably conceivable
alternative false positive (FP) hypotheses. The candidate is considered
as validated if the posterior probability of the planetary hypothesis is
sufficiently larger than the sum of the probabilities of all FP
scenarios. In this paper, we present PASTIS, the Planet Analysis and
Small Transit Investigation Software, a tool designed to perform a
rigorous model comparison of the hypotheses involved in the problem of
planet validation, and to fully exploit the information available in the
candidate light curves. PASTIS self-consistently models the transit
light curves and follow-up observations. Its object-oriented structure
offers a large flexibility for defining the scenarios to be compared.
The performance is explored using artificial transit light curves of
planets and FPs with a realistic error distribution obtained from a
Kepler light curve. We find that data support the correct hypothesis
strongly only when the signal is high enough (transit signal-to-noise
ratio above 50 for the planet case) and remain inconclusive otherwise.
PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) shall provide
transits with high enough signal-to-noise ratio, but to establish the
true nature of the vast majority of Kepler and CoRoT transit candidates
additional data or strong reliance on hypotheses priors is needed.},

	abstract = {The statistical validation of transiting exoplanets proved to be an efficient technique to secure the nature of small exoplanet signals which cannot be established by purely spectroscopic means. However, the spectroscopic diagnoses are providing us with useful constraints on the presence of blended stellar contaminants. In this paper, we present how a contaminating star affects the measurements of the various spectroscopic diagnoses as a function of the parameters of the target and contaminating stars using the model implemented into the PASTIS planet-validation software. We find particular cases for which a blend might produce a large radial velocity signal but no bisector variation. It might also produce a bisector variation anticorrelated with the radial velocity one, as in the case of stellar spots. In those cases, the full width at half-maximum variation provides complementary constraints. These results can be used to constrain blend scenarios for transiting planet candidates or radial velocity planets. We review all the spectroscopic diagnoses reported in the literature so far, especially the ones to monitor the line asymmetry. We estimate their uncertainty and compare their sensitivity to blends. Based on that, we recommend the use of BiGauss which is the most sensitive diagnosis to monitor line-profile asymmetry. In this paper, we also investigate the sensitivity of the radial velocities to constrain blend scenarios and develop a formalism to estimate the level of dilution of a blended signal. Finally, we apply our blend model to re-analyse the spectroscopic diagnoses of HD 16702, an unresolved face-on binary which exhibits bisector variations.},

	abstract = {Light curves from the Kepler Mission contain valuable information on the 
nature of the phenomena producing the transit-like signals. To assist in
exploring the possibility that they are due to an astrophysical false
positive, we describe a procedure (BLENDER) to model the photometry in
terms of a "blend" rather than a planet orbiting a star. A blend may
consist of a background or foreground eclipsing binary (or star-planet
pair) whose eclipses are attenuated by the light of the candidate and
possibly other stars within the photometric aperture. We apply BLENDER
to the case of Kepler-9 (KIC 3323887), a target harboring two previously
confirmed Saturn-size planets (Kepler-9 b and Kepler-9 c) showing
transit timing variations, and an additional shallower signal with a
1.59 day period suggesting the presence of a super-Earth-size planet.
Using BLENDER together with constraints from other follow-up
observations we are able to rule out all blends for the two deeper
signals and provide independent validation of their planetary nature.
For the shallower signal, we rule out a large fraction of the false
positives that might mimic the transits. The false alarm rate for
remaining blends depends in part (and inversely) on the unknown
frequency of small-size planets. Based on several realistic estimates of
this frequency, we conclude with very high confidence that this small
signal is due to a super-Earth-size planet (Kepler-9 d) in a multiple
system, rather than a false positive. The radius is determined to be
1.64+0.19 -0.14 R ⊕, and current
spectroscopic observations are as yet insufficient to establish its
mass.},

This situation is especially acute with the Kepler survey, which has found over 2300 candidates but has to date confirmed only a small fraction of them as planets. I present here a general procedure that can quickly be applied to any planet candidate to calculate its false positive probability. This procedure takes into account the period, depth, duration, and shape of the signal; the colors of the target star; arbitrary spectroscopic or imaging follow-up observations; and informed assumptions about the populations and distributions of field stars and multiple-star properties. Applying these methods to a sample of known Kepler planets, I demonstrate that many signals can be validated with very limited follow-up observations: in most cases with only a spectrum and an adaptive optics image. Additionally, I demonstrate that this procedure can reliably identify false positive signals. Because of the computational efficiency of this analysis, it is feasible to apply it to all Kepler planet candidates in the near future, and it will streamline the follow-up efforts for Kepler and other current and future transit surveys.},

Thousands of binary stars were measured with diffraction-limited resolution (29mas at 540nm wavelength) and a high accuracy reaching 1mas; two hundred new pairs or subsystems were discovered. To date, HRCam has performed over 11000 observations with a high efficiency (up to 300 stars per night). An overview of the main results delivered by this instrument is given.},

AIJ reads and writes standard Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) files, as well as other common image formats, provides FITS header viewing and editing, and is World Coordinate System aware, including an automated interface to the astrometry.net web portal for plate solving images. AIJ provides research grade image calibration and analysis tools with a GUI driven approach, and easily installed cross-platform compatibility.

	abstract = {The ages of the most common stars—low-mass (cool) stars like the Sun, and smaller—are difficult to derive because traditional dating methods use stellar properties that either change little as the stars age or are hard to measure. The rotation rates of all cool stars decrease substantially with time as the stars steadily lose their angular momenta. If properly calibrated, rotation therefore can act as a reliable determinant of their ages based on the method of gyrochronology. To calibrate gyrochronology, the relationship between rotation period and age must be determined for cool stars of different masses, which is best accomplished with rotation period measurements for stars in clusters with well-known ages. Hitherto, such measurements have been possible only in clusters with ages of less than about one billion years, and gyrochronology ages for older stars have been inferred from model predictions. Here we report rotation period measurements for 30 cool stars in the 2.5-billion-year-old cluster NGC 6819. The periods reveal a well-defined relationship between rotation period and stellar mass at the cluster age, suggesting that ages with a precision of order 10 per cent can be derived for large numbers of cool Galactic field stars.},

	abstract = {Rotation periods are increasingly being used to derive ages for cool single field stars. Such ages are based on an empirical understanding of how cool stars spin down, acquired by constructing color-period diagrams (CPDs) for a series of open clusters. Our main aims here are to construct a CPD for M 48, to compare this with other clusters of similar age to check for consistency, and to derive a rotational age for M 48 using gyrochronology. We monitored M 48 photometrically for over 2 months with AIP's STELLA I 1.2 m telescope and the WiFSIP 4K imager in Tenerife. Light curves with 3 mmag precision for bright (V{\textasciitilde}14 mag) stars were produced and then analysed to provide rotation periods. A cluster CPD has then been constructed. We report 62 rotation periods for cool stars in M 48. The CPD displays a clear slow/I-sequence of rotating stars, similar to those seen in the 625 Myr-old Hyades and 590 Myr-old Praesepe clusters, and below both, confirming that M 48 is younger. A similar comparison with the 250 Myr-old M 34 cluster shows that M 48 is older and does not possess any fast/C-sequence G or early K stars like those in M 34, although relatively fast rotators do seem to be present among the late-K and M stars. A more detailed comparison of the CPD with rotational evolution models shows that the cluster stars have a mean age of 450 Myr, and its (rotating) stars can be individually dated to +-117 Myr (26\%). Much of this uncertainty stems from intrinsic astrophysical spread in initial periods, and almost all stars are consistent with a single age of 450 Myr. The gyro-age of M 48 as a whole is 450+-50 Myr, in agreement with the previously determined isochrone age of 400+-100 Myr.},

	abstract = {Exoplanets orbiting pre-main-sequence stars are laboratories for studying planet evolution processes, including atmospheric loss, orbital migration, and radiative cooling. V1298 Tau, a young solar analog with an age of 23 ± 4 Myr, is one such laboratory. The star is already known to host a Jupiter-sized planet on a 24 day orbit. Here, we report the discovery of three additional planets—all between the sizes of Neptune and Saturn—based on our analysis of K2 Campaign 4
photometry. Planets c and d have sizes of 5.6 and 6.4 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus , respectively, and with orbital periods of 8.25 and 12.40 days reside 0.25\% outside of the nominal 3:2 mean-motion resonance. Planet e is 8.7 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus in size but only transited once in the K2 time series and thus has a period longer than 36 days, but likely shorter than 223 days. The V1298 Tau system may be a precursor to the compact multiplanet systems found to be common by the Kepler mission. However, the large planet sizes stand in sharp contrast to the vast majority of Kepler multiplanet systems, which have planets smaller than 3 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus . Simple dynamical arguments suggest total masses of {\textless}28 \{M\}{\textbackslash}oplus and {\textless}120 \{M\}{\textbackslash}oplus for
the c-d and d-b planet pairs, respectively. The implied low
masses suggest that the planets may still be radiatively cooling and contracting, and perhaps losing atmosphere. The V1298 Tau system offers rich prospects for further follow-up including atmospheric
characterization by transmission or eclipse spectroscopy, dynamical characterization through transit-timing variations, and measurements of planet masses and obliquities by radial velocities.},

Jupiters have been previously reported around young stars, those planets are non-transiting and near-term atmospheric characterization is not feasible. The V1298 Tau system is a compelling target for follow-up study through transmission spectroscopy and Doppler tomography owing to the transit depth (0.5\%), host star brightness (K s = 8.1 mag), and rapid stellar rotation (v{\textbackslash}sin i = 23 km s-1). Although the planet is Jupiter-sized, its mass is currently unknown due to high-amplitude radial velocity jitter. Nevertheless, V1298 Tau b may help constrain formation scenarios for at least one class of close-in exoplanets, providing a window into the nascent evolution of planetary interiors and atmospheres.},

	abstract = {Open clusters have been the focus of several exoplanet surveys, but only 
a few planets have so far been discovered. The Kepler spacecraft
revealed an abundance of small planets around small cool stars,
therefore, such cluster members are prime targets for exoplanet transit
searches. Kepler's new mission, K2, is targeting several open clusters
and star-forming regions around the ecliptic to search for transiting
planets around their low-mass constituents. Here, we report the
discovery of the first transiting planet in the intermediate-age (800
Myr) Beehive cluster (Praesepe). K2-95 is a faint (K\{\{p\}\}=15.5 \{mag\})
\{\{M\}\}3.0+/- 0.5 dwarf from K2's Campaign 5 with an effective temperature
of 3471+/- 124 \{\{K\}\}, approximately solar metallicity and a radius of
0.402+/- 0.050 \{R\}⊙ . We detected a transiting planet
with a radius of \{3.47\}-0.53+0.78 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus
 and an orbital period of 10.134 days. We combined photometry,
medium/high-resolution spectroscopy, adaptive optics/speckle imaging,
and archival survey images to rule out any false-positive detection
scenarios, validate the planet, and further characterize the system. The
planet’s radius is very unusual as M-dwarf field stars rarely have
Neptune-sized transiting planets. The comparatively large radius of
K2-95b is consistent with the other recently discovered cluster planets
K2-25b (Hyades) and K2-33b (Upper Scorpius), indicating systematic
differences in their evolutionary states or formation. These discoveries
from K2 provide a snapshot of planet formation and evolution in cluster
environments and thus make excellent laboratories to test differences
between field-star and cluster planet populations.},

	abstract = {We report the distribution of planets as a function of planet radius, orbital period, and stellar effective temperature for orbital periods less than 50 days around solar-type (GK) stars. These results are based on the 1235 planets (formally "planet candidates") from the Kepler mission that include a nearly complete set of detected planets as small as 2 R ⊕. For each of the 156,000 target stars, we
assess the detectability of planets as a function of planet radius, R p, and orbital period, P, using a measure of the detection efficiency for each star. We also correct for the geometric probability of transit, R sstarf/a. We consider first Kepler target stars within the "solar subset" having T eff = 4100-6100 K, log g = 4.0-4.9, and Kepler magnitude Kp {\textless} 15 mag, i.e., bright,
main-sequence GK stars. We include only those stars having photometric noise low enough to permit detection of planets down to 2 R
⊕. We count planets in small domains of R p and P and divide by the included target stars to calculate planet occurrence in each domain. The resulting occurrence of planets varies by more than three orders of magnitude in the radius-orbital period plane and increases substantially down to the smallest radius (2 R
⊕) and out to the longest orbital period (50 days,
{\textasciitilde}0.25 AU) in our study. For P {\textless} 50 days, the distribution of planet radii is given by a power law, df/dlog R = kRR
α with kR = 2.9+0.5 -
0.4, α = -1.92 ± 0.11, and R ≡ R p/R
⊕. This rapid increase in planet occurrence with
decreasing planet size agrees with the prediction of core-accretion formation but disagrees with population synthesis models that predict a desert at super-Earth and Neptune sizes for close-in orbits. Planets with orbital periods shorter than 2 days are extremely rare; for R p {\textgreater} 2 R ⊕ we measure an occurrence of
less than 0.001 planets per star. For all planets with orbital periods less than 50 days, we measure occurrence of 0.130 ± 0.008, 0.023 ± 0.003, and 0.013 ± 0.002 planets per star for planets
with radii 2-4, 4-8, and 8-32 R ⊕, in agreement with
Doppler surveys. We fit occurrence as a function of P to a power-law model with an exponential cutoff below a critical period P 0. For smaller planets, P 0 has larger values, suggesting that the "parking distance" for migrating planets moves outward with
decreasing planet size. We also measured planet occurrence over a broader stellar T eff range of 3600-7100 K, spanning M0 to F2 dwarfs. Over this range, the occurrence of 2-4 R ⊕
planets in the Kepler field increases with decreasing T eff, with these small planets being seven times more abundant around cool stars (3600-4100 K) than the hottest stars in our sample (6600-7100 K).

	abstract = {We report on the results of an 8-year survey carried out at the La Silla 
Observatory with the HARPS spectrograph to detect and characterize
planets in the super-Earth and Neptune mass regime. The size of our star
sample and the precision achieved with HARPS have allowed the detection
of a sufficiently large number of low-mass planets to study the
statistical properties of their orbital elements, the correlation of the
host-star metallicity with the planet masses, as well as the occurrence
rate of planetary systems around solar-type stars. A robust estimate of
the frequency of systems shows that more than 50\% of solar-type stars
harbor at least one planet of any mass and with period up to 100 days.
Different properties are observed for the population of planets less
massive than about 30M-Earth compared to the population of gaseous giant
planets. The mass distribution of Super-Earths and Neptune-mass planets
(SEN) is strongly increasing between 30 and 15M-Earth. The SEN occurence
rate does not exhibit a preference for metal rich stars. Most of the SEN
planets belong to multi-planetary systems. The orbital eccentricities of
the SEN planets seems limited to 0.45. At the opposite, the occurence
rate of gaseous giant planets is growing with the logarithm of the
period, and is strongly increasing with the host-star metallicity. About
14\% of solar-type stars have a planetary companion more massive than
50M-Earth? on an orbit with a period shorter than 10 years. Orbital
eccentricities of giant planets are observed up to 0.9 and beyond. The
precision of HARPS-type spectrographs opens the possibility to detect
planets in the habitable zone of solar-type stars. Identification of a
significant number of super-Earths orbiting solar-type of the Sun
vicinity is achieved by Doppler spectroscopy. 37 newly discovered
planets are announced in the Appendix of this paper, among which 15
Super-Earths.},

We investigate the noise properties of our data, finding correlated `red' noise at the {\textasciitilde}1-1.5 mmag level in bright stars, over transit-like time-scales of 2.5h. An important source of correlated noise in aperture photometry is image blending, which produces variations correlated with the seeing. We present a simple blend index based on fitting polynomials to these variations, and find that subtracting the fit from the data provides a method to reduce their amplitude, in lieu of using techniques, such as point spread function fitting photometry, which tackle their cause. Finally, we use the SYSREM algorithm to search for any further systematic effects.},

	abstract = {The Monitor project is a photometric monitoring survey of nine young (1-200Myr) clusters in the solar neighbourhood to search for eclipses by very low mass stars and brown dwarfs and for planetary transits in the light curves of cluster members. It began in the autumn of 2004 and uses several 2- to 4-m telescopes worldwide. We aim to calibrate the relation between age, mass, radius and where possible luminosity, from the K dwarf to the planet regime, in an age range where constraints on evolutionary models are currently very scarce. Any detection of an exoplanet in one of our youngest targets ({\textless}{\textasciitilde}10Myr) would also provide important constraints on planet formation and migration time-scales and their relation to protoplanetary disc lifetimes. Finally, we will use the light curves of cluster members to study rotation and flaring in low-mass pre-main-sequence stars.
	The present paper details the motivation, science goals and observing strategy of the survey. We present a method to estimate the sensitivity and number of detections expected in each cluster, using a simple semi-analytic approach which takes into account the characteristics of the cluster and photometric observations, using (tunable) best-guess assumptions for the incidence and parameter distribution of putative companions, and we incorporate the limits imposed by radial velocity follow-up from medium and large telescopes. We use these calculations to show that the survey as a whole can be expected to detect over 100 young low and very low mass eclipsing binaries, and {\textasciitilde}3 transiting planets with radial velocity signatures detectable with currently available
facilities.},

	abstract = {In the course of conducting a deep (14.5 lsim r lsim 23), 20 night 
survey for transiting planets in the rich {\textasciitilde}550 Myr old open cluster M37,
we have measured the rotation periods of 575 stars, which lie near the
cluster main sequence, with masses 0.2 M sun lsim M lsim 1.3
M sun. This is the largest sample of rotation periods for a
cluster older than 500 Myr. Using this rich sample we investigate a
number of relations between rotation period, color, and the amplitude of
photometric variability. Stars with M gsim 0.8 M sun show a
tight correlation between period and mass with heavier stars rotating
more rapidly. There is a group of four stars with P {\textgreater} 15 days that
fall well above this relation, which, if real, would present a
significant challenge to theories of stellar angular momentum evolution.
Below 0.8 M sun, the stars continue to follow the period-mass
correlation but with a broad tail of rapid rotators that expands to
shorter periods with decreasing mass. We combine these results with
observations of other open clusters to test the standard theory of lower
main-sequence stellar angular momentum evolution. We find that the model
reproduces the observations for solar-mass stars, but discrepancies are
apparent for stars with 0.6 lsim M lsim 1.0 M sun. We also
find that for late K through early M dwarf stars in this cluster, rapid
rotators tend to be bluer than slow rotators in B - V but redder than
slow rotators in V - IC . This result supports the hypothesis
that the significant discrepancy between the observed and predicted
temperatures and radii of low-mass main-sequence stars is due to stellar
activity.

We present the results of a seven-year-long radial velocity survey of a sample of 88 main-sequence and evolved stars to reveal signatures of Jupiter-mass planets in the solar-age and solar-metallicity open cluster M 67. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim at studying the frequency of giant planets in this cluster with respect to the field stars. In addition, our sample is also ideal to perform a long-term study to compare the chemical composition of stars with and without giant planets in detail. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We analyzed precise radial velocity (RV) measurements obtained with the HARPS spectrograph at the European Southern Observatory (La Silla), the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence (France), the HRS spectrograph at the Hobby Eberly Telescope (Texas), and the HARPS-N spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (La Palma). Additional RV data come from the CORALIE spectrograph at the Euler Swiss Telescope (La Silla). We conducted Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the occurrence rate of giant planets in our radial velocity survey. We considered orbital periods between 1.0 day and 1000 days and planet masses between 0.2 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and 10.0 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. We used a measure of the observational detection efficiency to determine the frequency of planets for each star. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: All the planets previously announced in this RV campaign with their properties are summarized here: 3 hot Jupiters around the main-sequence stars YBP1194, YBP1514, and YBP401, and 1 giant planet around the evolved star S364. Two additional planet candidates around the stars YBP778 and S978 are also analyzed in the present work. We discuss stars that exhibit large RV variability or trends individually. For 2 additional stars, long-term trends are compatible with new binary candidates or substellar objects, which increases the total number of binary candidates detected in our campaign to 14. Based on the Doppler-detected planets discovered in this survey, we find an occurrence of giant planets of 18.0{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+12.0{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-8.0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\% in the selected period-mass range. This frequency is slightly higher but consistent within the errors with the estimate for the field stars, which leads to the general conclusion that open cluster and field statistics agree. However, we find that the rate of hot Jupiters in the cluster ( 5.7{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+5.5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-3.0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\%) is substantially higher than in the field.

	abstract = {The ∼2 Myr old classical T Tauri star CI Tau shows periodic variability in its radial velocity (RV) variations measured at infrared (IR) and optical wavelengths. We find that these observations are consistent with a massive planet in a ∼9 day period orbit. These results are based on 71 IR RV measurements of this system obtained over five years, and on 26 optical RV measurements obtained over nine years. CI Tau was also observed photometrically in the optical on 34 nights over ∼one month in 2012. The optical RV data alone are inadequate to identify an orbital period, likely the result of star spot and activity-induced noise for this relatively small data set. The infrared RV measurements reveal significant periodicity at ∼9 days. In addition, the full set of optical and IR RV measurements taken together phase coherently and with equal amplitudes to the ∼9 day period. Periodic RV signals can in principle be produced by cool spots, hotspots, and reflection of the stellar spectrum off the inner disk, in addition to resulting from a planetary companion. We have considered each of these and find the planet hypothesis most consistent with the data. The RV amplitude yields an of ∼8.1 M Jup; in conjunction with a 1.3 mm continuum emission measurement of the circumstellar disk inclination from the literature, we find a planet mass of ∼11.3 M Jup, assuming alignment of the planetary orbit with the disk.},

This work seeks to identify nearby young stars showing a Lithium 6707.78\${\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}AA\$ absorption line in the GALAH survey. A robust, data-driven approach is used to search for corresponding templates in the pool of 434,215 measured dwarf spectra in the survey. It enables a model-free search for best-matching spectral templates for all stars, including M dwarfs with strong molecular absorption bands. 3147 stars have been found to have measurable Lithium: 1408 G and 892 K0-K5 dwarfs (EW(Li)\${\textgreater}\$0.1\${\textbackslash},\${\textbackslash}AA), 335 K5-K9 (\${\textgreater}\$0.07\${\textbackslash},\${\textbackslash}AA) and 512 M0\${\textbackslash}sim\$M4 dwarfs (\${\textgreater}\$0.05\${\textbackslash},\${\textbackslash}AA). Stars with such Lithium features are used to investigate the possibility of searching for young stars above the main sequence based merely on their parallaxes and broad-band photometry. Selection of young stars above the main sequence is highly effective for M dwarfs, moderately effective for K dwarfs and ineffective for G dwarfs. Using a combination of the Lithium information and the complete 6D kinematics from Gaia and GALAH, 305 new candidate moving group members have been found, 123 of which belong to the Scorpius-Centaurus association, 36 to the Pleiades and 25 to the Hyades clusters.},

solar-like stars and cooler dwarfs from the RAVE survey is addressed in
this paper. An improved activity identification with respect to the
previous study was introduced to build a catalog of field stars in the
solar neighborhood with an excess emission flux in the calcium infrared
triplet wavelength region. The central result of this work is the
calibration of the age-activity relation for main-sequence dwarfs in a
range from a few 10 \{Myr\} up to a few Gyr. It enabled an order of
magnitude age estimation of the entire active sample. Almost 15,000
stars are shown to be younger than 1 \{Gyr\} and ∼2000 younger than
100 \{Myr\}. The young age of the most active stars is confirmed by their
position off the main sequence in the J - K versus \{N\}\{UV\}-V
diagram showing strong ultraviolet excess, mid-infrared excess in the J
- K versus \{W\}1-\{W\}2 diagram, and very cool
temperatures (J-K{\textgreater} 0.7). They overlap with the reference
pre-main-sequence RAVE stars often displaying X-ray emission. The
activity level increasing with the color reveals their different nature
from the solar-like stars and probably represents an underlying
dynamo-generating magnetic fields in cool stars. Of the RAVE objects
from DR5, 50\% are found in the TGAS catalog and supplemented with
accurate parallaxes and proper motions by Gaia. This makes the database
of a large number of young stars in a combination with RAVE’s
radial velocities directly useful as a tracer of the very recent
large-scale star formation history in the solar neighborhood. The data

Exoplanets with well-constrained ages, particularly those which are young, are useful as benchmarks for studies aiming to constrain the evolutionary timescales relevant for planets. Such timescales may concern orbital migration, gravitational contraction, or atmospheric photoevaporation, among other mechanisms. Here we report the discovery of an adolescent transiting sub-Neptune from K2 photometry of the low-mass star EPIC 247267267.

has led to the common use of the Ca II H and K emission index
(R'HK = LHK/Lbol) as an
empirical age estimator for solar-type dwarfs, existing activity-age
relations produce implausible ages at both high and low activity levels.
We have compiled R'HK data from the literature for
young stellar clusters, richly populating for the first time the young
end of the activity-age relation. Combining the cluster activity data
with modern cluster age estimates and analyzing the color dependence of
the chromospheric activity age index, we derive an improved activity-age
calibration for F7-K2 dwarfs (0.5 mag {\textless} B - V {\textless} 0.9 mag ). We also
present a more fundamentally motivated activity-age calibration that
relies on conversion of R'HK values through the
Rossby number to rotation periods and then makes use of improved
gyrochronology relations. We demonstrate that our new activity-age
calibration has typical age precision of {\textasciitilde}0.2 dex for normal solar-type
dwarfs aged between the Hyades and the Sun ({\textasciitilde}0.6-4.5 Gyr). Inferring
ages through activity-rotation-age relations accounts for some
color-dependent effects and systematically improves the age estimates
(albeit only slightly). We demonstrate that coronal activity as measured
through the fractional X-ray luminosity (RX =
LX/Lbol) has nearly the same age- and
rotation-inferring capability as chromospheric activity measured through
R'HK. As a first application of our calibrations,
we provide new activity-derived age estimates for a volume-limited
sample of the 108 solar-type field dwarfs within 16 pc.},

	abstract = {Among the available methods for dating stars, gyrochronology is a powerful one because it requires knowledge of only the star's mass and rotation period. Gyrochronology relations have previously been calibrated using young clusters, with the Sun providing the only age dependence, and are therefore poorly calibrated at late ages. We used rotation period measurements of 310 Kepler stars with asteroseismic ages, 50 stars from the Hyades and Coma Berenices clusters and 6 field stars (including the Sun) with precise age measurements to calibrate the gyrochronology relation, whilst fully accounting for measurement uncertainties in all observable quantities. We calibrated a relation of the form \$P=A{\textasciicircum}n{\textbackslash}times(B-V-c){\textasciicircum}b\$, where \$P\$ is rotation period in days, \$A\$ is age in Myr, \$B\$ and \$V\$ are magnitudes and \$a\$, \$b\$ and \$n\$ are the free parameters of our model. We found \$a = 0.40{\textasciicircum}\{+0.3\}\_\{-0.05\}\$, \$b = 0.31{\textasciicircum}\{+0.05\}\_\{-0.02\}\$ and \$n = 0.55{\textasciicircum}\{+0.02\}\_\{-0.09\}\$. Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods were used to explore the posterior probability distribution functions of the gyrochronology parameters and we carefully checked the effects of leaving out parts of our sample, leading us to find that no single relation beween rotation period, colour and age can adequately describe all the subsets of our data. The Kepler asteroseismic stars, cluster stars and local field stars cannot all be described by the same gyrochronology relation. The Kepler asteroseismic stars may be subject to observational biases, however the clusters show unexpected deviations from the predicted behaviour, providing concerns for the overall reliability of gyrochronology as a dating method.},

Here, we review observations and theoretical models for the formation, evolution, and eventual disruption of star clusters. Current literature suggests a picture of this life cycle including the following several phases: Clusters form in hierarchically structured, accreting molecular clouds that convert gas into stars at a low rate per dynamical time until feedback disperses the gas. The densest parts of the hierarchy resist gas removal long enough to reach high star-formation efficiency, becoming dynamically relaxed and well mixed. These remain bound after gas removal. In the first ∼100 Myr after gas removal, clusters
disperse moderately fast, through a combination of mass loss and tidal shocks by dense molecular structures in the star-forming environment. After ∼100 Myr, clusters lose mass via two-body relaxation and
shocks by giant molecular clouds, processes that preferentially affect low-mass clusters and cause a turnover in the cluster mass function to appear on ∼1-10-Gyr timescales. Even after dispersal, some clusters remain coherent and thus detectable in chemical or action space for multiple galactic orbits.In the next decade, a new generation of space- and adaptive optics-assisted ground-based telescopes will enable us to test and refine this picture.},

	abstract = {Stellar clusters are born embedded within giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and during their formation and early evolution are often only visible at infrared wavelengths, being heavily obscured by dust. Over the past 15 years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge
concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic embedded clusters. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within 2 kpc of the sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4-7\% of embedded clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90\%) of stars that form in embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in excess of 50 M⊙. Moreover, observations of
nearby cloud complexes indicate that embedded clusters account for a significant (70-90\%) fraction of all stars formed in GMCs. We review the role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the initial mass function (IMF) that, in one nearby example, has been measured over the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to substellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.},

This review presents a summary of the available techniques for age-dating stars and ensembles of stars, their realms of applicability, and their strengths and weaknesses. My emphasis is on low-mass stars because they are present from all epochs of star formation in the Galaxy and because they present both special opportunities and problems. The ages of open clusters are important for understanding the limitations of stellar models and for calibrating empirical age indicators. For individual stars, a hierarchy of quality for the available age-dating methods is described. Although our present ability to determine the ages of even the nearest stars is mediocre, the next few years hold great promise as asteroseismology probes beyond stellar surfaces and starts to provide precise interior properties of stars and as models continue to improve when stressed by better observations.},

been searched for companions, and are therefore not confirmed single stars. We previously found that nearly all rapidly rotating ≳ 0.3 \{M\}⊙ stars in the Hyades are binaries, but we require deeper binary searches in Praesepe to confirm whether binaries in these two co-eval clusters have different P rot distributions. We also compare the observed P rot distribution in Praesepe to that predicted by models of angular-momentum evolution. We do not observe the clear bimodal P rot distribution predicted by Brown for {\textgreater}0.5 \{M\}⊙ stars at the age of Praesepe,
but 0.25-0.5 \{M\}⊙ stars do show stronger
bimodality. In addition, we find that {\textgreater}60\% of early M dwarfs in
Praesepe rotate more slowly than predicted at 650 Myr by Matt et al., which suggests an increase in braking efficiency for these stars relative to solar-type stars and fully convective stars. The
incompleteness of surveys for binaries in open clusters likely impacts our comparison with these models since the models only attempt to describe the evolution of isolated single stars.},

slower than their Praesepe counterparts. This \{P\vphantom{\{}\}rot\}
difference indicates that the Hyades is slightly older than Praesepe: we
apply a new gyrochronology model tuned with Praesepe and the Sun and
find an age difference between the two clusters of 57 Myr. However, this
\{P\vphantom{\{}\}rot\} difference decreases and eventually disappears for
lower-mass stars. This provides further evidence for stalling in the

	abstract = {Stellar rotation was proposed as a potential age diagnostic that is precise, simple, and applicable to a broad range of low-mass stars (≤slant 1 \{M\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉ {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}). Unfortunately, rotation period (\{P\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}\{\{rot{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}\}) measurements of low-mass members of open clusters have undermined the idea that stars spin down with a common age dependence (i.e., \{P\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}\{\{rot{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}\} {\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}sqrt\{age\vphantom{\{}\}\}): K dwarfs appear to spin down more slowly than F and G dwarfs. Agüeros et al. interpreted data for the ≈1.4 Gyr-old cluster NGC 752 differently, proposing that after having converged onto a slow-rotating sequence in their first 600-700 Myr (by the age of Praesepe), K dwarf \{P\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}\{\{rot{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}\} stall on that sequence for an extended period of time. We use data from Gaia DR2 to identify likely single-star members of the ≈1 Gyr-old cluster NGC 6811 with Kepler light curves. We measure \{P\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}\{\{rot{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}\} for 171 members, more than doubling the sample relative to the existing catalog and extending the mass limit from ≈ 0.8 to ≈0.6 \{M\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉ {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. We then apply a gyrochronology formula calibrated with Praesepe and the Sun to 27 single G dwarfs in NGC 6811 to derive a precise gyrochronological age for the cluster of 1.04 ± 0.07 Gyr. However, when our new low-mass rotators are included, NGC 6811's color-\{P\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}\{\{rot{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}\} sequence deviates away from the naive 1 Gyr projection down to \{T\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}\{\{eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}\}≈ 4295 K (K5V, 0.7 \{M\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉ {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), where it clearly overlaps with Praesepe’s. Combining these data with \{P\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}\{\{rot{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}\} for other clusters, we conclude that the assumption that mass and age are separable dependencies is invalid. Furthermore, the cluster data show definitively that stars experience a temporary epoch of reduced braking efficiency where \{P\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}\{\{rot{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}\} stall, and that the duration of this epoch lasts longer for lower-mass stars.},

We used K2 to explore the distribution of rotation periods in the Pleiades. With more than 500 new periods for Pleiades members, we are vastly expanding the number of Pleiades with periods, particularly at the low-mass end. About 92\% of the members in our sample have at least one measured spot-modulated rotation period. For the ̃8\% of the members without periods, non-astrophysical effects often dominate (saturation, etc.), such that periodic signals might have been detectable, all other things being equal. We now have an unusually complete view of the rotation distribution in the Pleiades. The relationship between P and \{(V-\{K\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}\{\{s{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}\})\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} follows the overall trends found in other Pleiades studies.

The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-ESO Survey also provides the cluster chemical composition. We obtain cluster parallaxes using two methods. The first one relies on the astrometric selection of a sample of bona fide members, while the other one fits the parallax distribution of a larger sample of TGAS sources.

	abstract = {Context. Open clusters are known as excellent tools for various topics in Galactic research. For example, they allow accurately tracing the chemical structure of the Galactic disc. However, the metallicity is known only for a rather low percentage of the open cluster population, and these values are based on a variety of methods and data. Therefore, a large and homogeneous sample is highly desirable. Aims: In the third part of our series we compile a large sample of homogenised open cluster metallicities using a wide variety of different sources. These data and a sample of Cepheids are used to investigate the radial metallicity gradient, age effects, and to test current models. Methods: We used photometric and spectroscopic data to derive cluster metallicities. The different sources were checked and tested for possible offsets and correlations. Results: In total,
metallicities for 172 open cluster were derived. We used the
spectroscopic data of 100 objects for a study of the radial metallicity distribution and the age-metallicity relation. We found a possible increase of metallicity with age, which, if confirmed, would provide observational evidence for radial migration. Although a statistical significance is given, more studies are certainly needed to exclude selection effects, for example. The comparison of open clusters and Cepheids with recent Galactic models agrees well in general. However, the models do not reproduce the flat gradient of the open clusters in the outer disc. Thus, the effect of radial migration is either
underestimated in the models, or an additional mechanism is at work. Conclusions: Apart from the Cepheids, open clusters are the best tracers for metallicity over large Galactocentric distances in the Milky Way. For a sound statistical analysis, a sufficiently large and
homogeneous sample of cluster metallicities is needed. Our compilation is currently by far the largest and provides the basis for several basic studies such as the statistical treatment of the Galactic cluster population, or evolutionary studies of individual star groups in open clusters.},

	abstract = {Context. The origin and dynamical evolution of star clusters is an 
important topic in stellar astrophysics. Several models have been
proposed in order to understand the formation of bound and unbound
clusters and their evolution, and they can be tested by examining the
kinematical and dynamical properties of clusters over a wide range of
ages and masses. Aims: We use the Gaia-ESO Survey products to
study four open clusters (IC 2602, IC 2391, IC 4665, and NGC 2547) that
lie in the age range between 20 and 50 Myr. Methods: We employ
the gravity index γ and the equivalent width of the lithium line
at 6708 Å together with effective temperature Teff and
the metallicity of the stars in order to discard observed contaminant
stars. Then we derive the cluster radial velocity dispersions
σc, the total cluster mass Mtot, and the
half mass radius rhm. Using the Gaia-DR1 TGAS catalogue, we
independently derive the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the clusters
from the astrometric parameters of cluster members. Results: The
intrinsic radial velocity dispersions derived by the spectroscopic data
are higher than those derived from the TGAS data, possibly due to the
different masses of the considered stars. Using Mtot and
rhm we derive the virial velocity dispersion
σvir and we find that three out of four clusters are
supervirial. This result is in agreement with the hypothesis that these
clusters are dispersing, as predicted by the "residual gas expulsion"
scenario. However, recent simulations show that the virial ratio of
young star clustersmay be overestimated if it is determined using the
global velocity dispersion, since the clusters are not fully relaxed.},

Methods: We have made use of the membership determination based on the precise Gaia astrometry and photometry. We applied an automated Bayesian tool, BASE-9, to fit stellar isochrones on the observed G, GBP, GRP magnitudes of the high probability member stars.

	abstract = {Context. Open clusters are recognised as excellent tracers of Galactic 
thin-disc properties. At variance with intermediate-age and old open
clusters, for which a significant number of studies is now available,
clusters younger than ≲150 Myr have been mostly overlooked in terms
of their chemical composition until recently (with few exceptions). On
the other hand, previous investigations seem to indicate an anomalous
behaviour of young clusters, which includes (but is not limited to)
slightly sub-solar iron (Fe) abundances and extreme, unexpectedly high
barium (Ba) enhancements. Aims: In a series of papers, we plan to
expand our understanding of this topic and investigate whether these
chemical peculiarities are instead related to abundance analysis
techniques. Methods: We present a new determination of the
atmospheric parameters for 23 dwarf stars observed by the Gaia-ESO
survey in five young open clusters (τ {\textless} 150 Myr) and one
star-forming region (NGC 2264). We exploit a new method based on
titanium (Ti) lines to derive the spectroscopic surface gravity, and
most importantly, the microturbulence parameter. A combination of Ti and
Fe lines is used to obtain effective temperatures. We also infer the
abundances of Fe I, Fe II, Ti I, Ti II, Na I, Mg I, Al I, Si I, Ca I, Cr
I, and Ni I. Results: Our findings are in fair agreement with
Gaia-ESO iDR5 results for effective temperatures and surface gravities,
but suggest that for very young stars, the microturbulence parameter is
over-estimated when Fe lines are employed. This affects the derived
chemical composition and causes the metal content of very young clusters
to be under-estimated. Conclusions: Our clusters display a
metallicity [Fe/H] between +0.04 ± 0.01 and +0.12 ± 0.02;
they are not more metal poor than the Sun. Although based on a
relatively small sample size, our explorative study suggests that we may
not need to call for ad hoc explanations to reconcile the chemical
composition of young open clusters with Galactic chemical evolution
models.

We search for high-confidence comoving pairs of stars in TGAS by identifying pairs of stars consistent with having the same 3D velocity using a marginalized likelihood ratio test to discriminate candidate comoving pairs from the field population. Although we perform some visualizations using (bias-corrected) inverse parallax as a point estimate of distance, the likelihood ratio is computed with a probabilistic model that includes the covariances of parallax and proper motions and marginalizes the (unknown) true distances and 3D velocities of the stars. We find 13,085 comoving star pairs among 10,606 unique stars with separations as large as 10 pc (our search limit). Some of these pairs form larger groups through mutual comoving neighbors: many of these pair networks correspond to known open clusters and OB associations, but we also report the discovery of several new comoving groups.

subassociations. Detailed modeling of the broadband spectral energy distributions, particularly the strong silicate emission at 10 μm, shows that these objects are (pre-)transitional disks with some amount of small optically thin dust inside their cavities, ranging from ∼4 to ∼90 au in size. We analyzed Spitzer IRS spectra for two objects in the sample: CVSO-107 and CVSO-109. The IRS spectrum of CVSO-107 indicates the presence of crystalline material inside its gap, while the silicate feature of CVSO-109 is characterized by a pristine profile produced by amorphous silicates; the mechanisms creating the optically thin dust seem to depend on disk local conditions. Using millimeter photometry, we estimated dust disk masses for CVSO-107 and CVSO-109 lower than the minimum mass of solids needed to form the planets in our solar system, which suggests that giant planet formation should be over in these disks. We speculate that the presence and maintenance of optically thick material in the inner regions of these pre-transitional disks might point to low-mass planet formation.},

We find 3897 dwarfs with temperatures below 4000 K, including 64 planet candidate host stars orbited by 95 transiting planet candidates. We refit the transit events in the Kepler light curves for these planet candidates and combine the revised planet/star radius ratios with our improved stellar radii to revise the radii of the planet candidates orbiting the cool target stars. We then compare the number of observed planet candidates to the number of stars around which such planets could have been detected in order to estimate the planet occurrence rate around cool stars. We find that the occurrence rate of 0.5-4 R ⊕ planets with
orbital periods shorter than 50 days is 0.90{\textasciicircum}\{+0.04\}\_\{-0.03\} planets per star. The occurrence rate of Earth-size (0.5-1.4 R ⊕) planets is constant across the temperature range of our sample at 0.51\_\{-0.05\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.06\} Earth-size planets per star, but the occurrence of 1.4-4 R ⊕ planets decreases significantly at cooler
temperatures. Our sample includes two Earth-size planet candidates in the habitable zone, allowing us to estimate that the mean number of Earth-size planets in the habitable zone is 0.15{\textasciicircum}\{+0.13\}\_\{-0.06\} planets per cool star. Our 95\% confidence lower limit on the occurrence rate of Earth-size planets in the habitable zones of cool stars is 0.04 planets per star. With 95\% confidence, the nearest transiting Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of a cool star is within 21 pc. Moreover, the nearest non-transiting planet in the habitable zone is within 5 pc with 95\% confidence.},

star-forming region in order to characterize the primordial outcome of
multiple star formation and the extent of the brown dwarf desert. Our
survey identified 16 new binary companions to primary stars with masses
of 0.25-2.5 M sun, raising the total number of binary pairs
(including components of high-order multiples) with separations of
3-5000 AU to 90. We find that {\textasciitilde}2/3-3/4 of all Taurus members are
multiple systems of two or more stars, while the other {\textasciitilde}1/4-1/3 appear
to have formed as single stars; the distribution of high-order
multiplicity suggests that fragmentation into a wide binary has no
impact on the subsequent probability that either component will fragment
again. The separation distribution for solar-type stars (0.7-2.5 M
sun) is nearly log-flat over separations of 3-5000 AU, but
lower-mass stars (0.25-0.7 M sun) show a paucity of binary
companions with separations of gsim200 AU. Across this full mass range,
companion masses are well described with a linear-flat function; all
system mass ratios (q = MB /MA ) are equally
probable, apparently including substellar companions. Our results are
broadly consistent with the two expected modes of binary formation
(free-fall fragmentation on large scales and disk fragmentation on small
scales), but the distributions provide some clues as to the epochs at
which the companions are likely to form.},

traditional high-resolution imaging; we also summarize a complementary snapshot imaging survey that discovered seven directly resolved
companions. The overall frequency of binary companions
({\textasciitilde}35-4+5\% at separations of 6-435 AU) appears to be equivalent to field stars of similar mass, but companions could be more common among lower mass stars than for the field. The companion mass function has statistically significant differences compared to several suggested mass functions for the field, and we suggest an alternate lognormal parameterization of the mass function. Our survey limits encompass the entire brown dwarf mass range, but we only detected a single companion that might be a brown dwarf; this deficit resembles the so-called brown dwarf desert that has been observed by radial velocity planet searches. Finally, our survey's deep detection limits extend into the top of the planetary mass function, reaching 8-12 MJup for half of our sample. We have not identified any planetary companions at high confidence (gtrsim99.5\%), but we have identified four candidate companions at lower confidence (gtrsim97.5\%) that merit additional follow-up to confirm or disprove their existence.},

	abstract = {Stellar multiplicity is a ubiquitous outcome of the star-formation process. The frequency and main characteristics of multiple systems, and their dependence on primary mass and environment, are powerful tools to probe this process. Although early attempts were fraught with selection biases and limited completeness, instrumentation breakthroughs in the past two decades now enable robust statistical analyses. In this review, we summarize current empirical knowledge of stellar multiplicity for main sequence stars and brown dwarfs, as well as among populations of pre-main-sequence stars and embedded protostars. Among field objects, the multiplicity rate and breadth of the orbital period distribution are steep functions of the primary mass, whereas the mass ratio distribution is essentially flat for most populations other than the lowest mass objects. The time-variation of the frequency of visual companions follows two parallel, constant tracks corresponding to loose and dense stellar populations, although current observations do not yet distinguish whether initial multiplicity properties are universal or dependent on the physical conditions of the parent cloud. Nonetheless, these quantitative trends provide a rich comparison basis for numerical and analytical models of star formation.},

near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams. Using the spectral energy distribution slopes in the IRAC spectral range, we place objects into several classes: non-excess stars, stars with optically thick disks (such as classical T Tauri stars), class I (protostellar) candidates, and stars with ``evolved disks'' the last exhibit smaller IRAC excesses than optically thick disk systems. In general, this classification agrees with the location expected in IRAC-MIPS color-color diagrams for these objects. We find that the evolved disk systems are mostly a combination of objects with optically thick but nonflared disks, suggesting grain growth and/or settling, and transition disks, systems in which the inner disk is partially or fully cleared of small dust. In all, we identify seven transition disk candidates and three possible debris disk systems. As in other young stellar populations, the fraction of disks depends on the stellar mass, ranging from {\textasciitilde}10\% for stars in the Herbig Ae/Be mass range ({\textgreater}2 Msolar) to {\textasciitilde}35\% for those in the T Tauri mass range (1-0.1 Msolar). The IRAC infrared excesses found in stellar clusters and associations with and without central high-mass stars are similar, suggesting that external
photoevaporation is not very important in many clusters. Finally, we find no correlation between the X-ray luminosity and the disk infrared excess, suggesting that the X-rays are not strongly affected by disk accretion.},

candidates of the 5 Myr region located in the OB1b subassociation. The
25 Orionis aggregate shows a disk frequency of 6\%, while the field in
the OB1b subassociation shows a disk frequency of 13\%. Combining IRAC,
MIPS, and 2MASS photometry, we place stars bearing disks in several
classes: those with optically thick disks (class II systems), with an
inner transitional disks (transitional disk candidates), and with
``evolved disks'' the last exhibit smaller IRAC/MIPS excesses than class
II systems. In all, we identify one transitional disk candidate in the
25 Orionis aggregate and three in the OB1b field; this represents {\textasciitilde}10\%
of the disk-bearing stars, indicating that the transitional disk phase
can be relatively fast. We find that the frequency of disks is a
function of the stellar mass, suggesting a maximum around stars with
spectral type M0. Comparing the infrared excess in the IRAC bands among
several stellar groups, we find that inner disk emission decays with
stellar age, showing a correlation with the respective disk frequencies.
The disk emission at the IRAC and MIPS bands in several stellar groups
indicates that disk dissipation takes place faster in the inner region
of the disks. Comparison with models of irradiated accretion disks,
computed with several degrees of settling, suggests that the decrease in
the overall accretion rate observed in young stellar groups is not
sufficient to explain the weak disk emission observed in the IRAC bands
for disk-bearing stars with ages 5 Myr or older; larger degrees of dust
settling are necessary to explain these objects.},

of debris disks, without excess in the IRAC bands and without emission
lines in their optical spectra, but with a varying degree of 24 μm
excess. Comparing our samples with 24 μm observations of
intermediate-mass stars in other stellar groups, spanning a range of
ages from 2.5 to 150 Myr, we find that debris disks are more frequent
and have larger 24 μm excess at 10 Myr (OB1a). This trend agrees with
predictions of models of evolution of solids in the outer regions of
disks ({\textgreater}30 AU), where large icy objects ({\textasciitilde}1000 km) begin to form at
{\textasciitilde}10 Myr; the presence of these objects in the disk initiates a
collisional cascade, producing enough dust particles to explain the
relatively large 24 μm excess observed in OB1a. The dust luminosity
observed in the stellar groups older than 10 Myr declines roughly as
predicted by collisional cascade models. Combining Spitzer observations,
optical spectra, and 2MASS data, we found a new Herbig Ae/Be star (HD
290543) and a star (HD 36444) with a large 24 μm excess, both in
OB1b. This last object could be explained as a intermediate stage

disks systems, those stars do not exhibit emission lines in their

known Herbig Ae object which displays excesses in all Spitzer bands and
shows emission lines in its spectrum. We compare the disk population in
the λ Orionis cluster with the disk census in other stellar
groups studied using similar methods to detect and characterize their
disks and spanning a range of ages from 3 Myr to 10 Myr. We find that
for stellar groups of 5 Myr or older the observed disk frequency in
intermediate-mass stars (with spectral types from late B to early F) is
higher than in low-mass stars (with spectral types K and M). This is in
contradiction with the observed trend for primordial disk evolution, in
which stars with higher stellar masses dissipate their primordial disks
faster. At 3 Myr, the observed disk frequency in intermediate-mass stars
is still lower than for low-mass stars indicating that second generation
dusty disks start to dominate the disk population at 5 Myr for
intermediate-mass stars. This result agrees with recent models of
evolution of solids in the region of the disk where icy objects form
({\textgreater}30 AU), which suggest that at 5-10 Myr collisions start to produce
large amount of dust during the transition from runaway to oligarchic
growth (reaching sizes of {\textasciitilde}500 km) and then dust production peaks at

sections of the ecliptic plane. During its second campaign, K2 targeted
over 1000 young stellar objects (YSOs) in the ∼1-3 Myr ρ
Ophiuchus and 5-10 Myr Upper Scorpius regions. From this set, we have
carefully vetted photometry from WISE and Spitzer to identify those YSOs
with infrared excess indicative of primordial circumstellar disks. We
present here the resulting comprehensive sample of 288 young
disk-bearing stars from B through M spectral types and analysis of their
associated K2 light curves. Using statistics of periodicity and
symmetry, we categorize each light curve into eight different
variability classes, notably including “dippers” (fading
events), “bursters” (brightening events), stochastic, and
quasi-periodic types. Nearly all (96\%) of disk-bearing YSOs are
identified as variable at 30-minute cadence with the sub-1\% precision of
K2. Combining our variability classifications with (circum)stellar
properties, we find that the bursters, stochastic sources, and the
largest amplitude quasi-periodic stars have larger infrared colors, and
hence stronger circumstellar disks. They also tend to have larger
Hα equivalent widths, indicative of higher accretion rates. The
dippers, on the other hand, cluster toward moderate infrared colors and
low Hα. Using resolved disk observations, we further find that the
latter favor high inclinations, except for a few notable exceptions with
close to face-on disks. These observations support the idea that YSO
time-domain properties are dependent on several factors, including
accretion rate and view angle.},

Their optical light curves show ∼10-20 dips in flux over the 80-day observing campaign with durations of ∼0.5-2 days and depths of up to ∼40\%. These stars are all
members of the ρ Ophiuchus (∼1 Myr) or Upper Scorpius (∼10
Myr) star-forming regions. To investigate the nature of these
“dippers” we obtained: optical and near-infrared spectra to
determine stellar properties and identify accretion signatures; adaptive optics imaging to search for close companions that could cause optical variations and/or influence disk evolution; and millimeter-wavelength observations to constrain disk dust and gas masses. The spectra reveal Li I absorption and Hα emission consistent with stellar youth
({\textless}50 Myr), but also accretion rates spanning those of classical and weak-line T Tauri stars. Infrared excesses are consistent with
protoplanetary disks extending to within ∼10 stellar radii in most cases; however, the sub-millimeter observations imply disk masses that are an order of magnitude below those of typical protoplanetary disks. We find a positive correlation between dip depth and WISE-2 (Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer-2) excess, which we interpret as evidence that the dipper phenomenon is related to occulting structures in the inner disk, although this is difficult to reconcile with the weakly accreting aperiodic dippers. We consider three mechanisms to explain the dipper phenomenon: inner disk warps near the co-rotation radius related to accretion; vortices at the inner disk edge produced by the Rossby Wave Instability; and clumps of circumstellar material related to
planetesimal formation.},

K2 will use an innovative way of operating the spacecraft to observe target fields along the ecliptic for the next 2-3 years. Early science commissioning observations have shown an estimated photometric precision near 400 ppm in a single 30 minute observation, and a 6-hr photometric precision of 80 ppm (both at V = 12). The K2 mission offers long-term, simultaneous optical observation of thousands of objects at a precision far better than is achievable from ground-based telescopes. Ecliptic fields will be observed for approximately 75 days enabling a unique exoplanet survey which fills the gaps in duration and sensitivity between the Kepler and TESS missions, and offers pre-launch exoplanet target identification for JWST transit spectroscopy. Astrophysics observations with K2 will include studies of young open clusters, bright stars, galaxies, supernovae, and asteroseismology.},

	abstract = {We present an update to the EVEREST K2 pipeline that addresses various 
limitations in the previous version and improves the photometric
precision of the light curves. We develop a fast regularization scheme
for pixel-level decorrelation (PLD) and adapt the algorithm to include
the PLD vectors of other stars to enhance the predictive power of the
model and minimize overfitting, particularly for faint stars. We also
modify PLD to work for saturated stars and improve its performance on
variable stars, although some high-frequency variables may still suffer
from overfitting. On average, EVEREST 2.0 light curves have 10-20\%
higher photometric precision than those in version 1, yielding the
highest-precision light curves at all \{Kp\} magnitudes of any publicly
available K2 catalog. For most K2 campaigns, we recover the original
Kepler precision to at least \{Kp\} = 14, and to at least \{Kp\} = 15 for
campaigns 1, 5, 6, and 13. We also detrend most short-cadence targets
observed by K2, obtaining even higher photometric precision for these
stars. Like all aggressive, flexible models, EVEREST is prone to
overfitting, and may cause a decrease in transit depths by ∼10\% we
urge users to mask signals of interest using our open-source software,
which we show removes this bias. Light curves for campaigns 0-8 and
10-13 are available online in the EVEREST catalog, which will be updated
with future campaigns. EVEREST 2.0 is open source and is coded in a
framework that can be adapted to other photometric surveys, including
Kepler and the upcoming TESS mission.},

EVEREST employs a variant of pixel level decorrelation to remove systematics introduced by the spacecraft’s pointing error and a Gaussian process to capture astrophysical
variability. We apply EVEREST to all K2 targets in campaigns 0-7, yielding light curves with precision comparable to that of the original Kepler mission for stars brighter than \{K\}p≈ 13, and
within a factor of two of the Kepler precision for fainter targets. We perform cross-validation and transit injection and recovery tests to validate the pipeline, and compare our light curves to the other de-trended light curves available for download at the MAST High Level Science Products archive. We find that EVEREST achieves the highest average precision of any of these pipelines for unsaturated K2 stars. The improved precision of these light curves will aid in exoplanet detection and characterization, investigations of stellar variability, asteroseismology, and other photometric studies. The EVEREST pipeline can also easily be applied to future surveys, such as the TESS mission, to correct for instrumental systematics and enable the detection of low signal-to-noise transiting exoplanets. The EVEREST light curves and the source code used to generate them are freely available online.},

	abstract = {We use the Robo-AO survey of Kepler planetary candidate host stars, the largest adaptive optics survey yet performed, to measure the recovery rate of close stellar binaries in Gaia DR2. We find that Gaia recovers binaries down to 1″ at magnitude contrasts as large as six; closer systems are not resolved, regardless of secondary brightness. Gaia DR2 binary detection does not have a strong dependence on the orientation of the stellar pairs. We find 177 nearby stars to Kepler planetary candidate host stars in Gaia DR2 that were not detected in the Robo-AO survey, almost all of which are faint (G {\textgreater} 20); the remainder were largely targets observed by Robo-AO in poor conditions. If the primary star is the host, the impact on the radii estimates of planet candidates in these systems is likely minimal; many of these faint stars, however, could be faint eclipsing binaries that are the source of a false positive planetary transit signal. With Robo-AO and Gaia combined, we find that 18.7 ± 0.7\% of Kepler planet candidate hosts have nearby stars within 4″. We also find 36 nearby stars in Gaia DR2 around 35 planetary candidate host stars detected with K2. The nearby star fraction rate for K2 planetary candidates is significantly lower than that for the primary Kepler mission. The binary recovery rate of Gaia will improve initial radius estimates of future Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite planet candidates significantly; however, ground-based high-resolution follow-up observations are still needed for precise characterization and confirmation. The sensitivity of Gaia to closely separated binaries is expected to improve in later data releases.},

APOGEE-2 Young Cluster Survey. Existing membership catalogs span limited
portions of the OSFC, reflecting the difficulty of selecting targets
homogeneously across this extended, highly structured region. We have
used data from wide-field photometric surveys to produce a less biased
parent sample of young stellar objects (YSOs) with infrared (IR)
excesses indicative of warm circumstellar material or photometric
variability at optical wavelengths across the full 420 square degree
extent of the OSFC. When restricted to YSO candidates with H {\textless} 12.4,
to ensure S/N ∼ 100 for a six-visit source, this uniformly selected
sample includes 1307 IR excess sources selected using criteria vetted by
Koenig \& Liesawitz (2014) and 990 optical variables identified in
the Pan-STARRS1 3π survey: 319 sources exhibit both optical
variability and evidence of circumstellar disks through IR excess.
Objects from this uniformly selected sample received the highest
priority for targeting, but required fewer than half of the fibers on
each APOGEE-2 plate. We filled the remaining fibers with previously
confirmed and new color-magnitude selected candidate OSFC members.
Radial velocity measurements from APOGEE-1 and new APOGEE-2 observations
taken in the survey’s first year indicate that ∼90\% of the
uniformly selected targets have radial velocities consistent with Orion
membership. The APOGEE-2 Orion survey will include {\textgreater}1100 bona fide
YSOs whose uniform selection function will provide a robust sample for
comparative analyses of the stellar populations and properties across
all sub-regions of Orion.},

After a three-year observing campaign on the Sloan 2.5 m Telescope, APOGEE has collected a half million high-resolution (R ∼ 22,500), high signal-to-noise ratio ({\textgreater}100), infrared (1.51-1.70 μm) spectra for 146,000 stars, with
time series information via repeat visits to most of these stars. This paper describes the motivations for the survey and its overall
design—hardware, field placement, target selection,
operations—and gives an overview of these aspects as well as the data reduction, analysis, and products. An index is also given to the complement of technical papers that describe various critical survey components in detail. Finally, we discuss the achieved survey
performance and illustrate the variety of potential uses of the data products by way of a number of science demonstrations, which span from time series analysis of stellar spectral variations and radial velocity variations from stellar companions, to spatial maps of kinematics, metallicity, and abundance patterns across the Galaxy and as a function of age, to new views of the interstellar medium, the chemistry of star clusters, and the discovery of rare stellar species.

hundreds of thousands of Milky Way stars at high resolution and high

at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey is obtaining spatially
resolved spectroscopy for thousands of nearby galaxies (median z∼
0.03). The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is
mapping the galaxy, quasar, and neutral gas distributions between z∼
0.6 and 3.5 to constrain cosmology using baryon acoustic oscillations,
redshift space distortions, and the shape of the power spectrum. Within
eBOSS, we are conducting two major subprograms: the SPectroscopic
IDentification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS), investigating X-ray AGNs
and galaxies in X-ray clusters, and the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey
(TDSS), obtaining spectra of variable sources. All programs use the 2.5
m Sloan Foundation Telescope at the Apache Point Observatory;
observations there began in Summer 2014. APOGEE-2 also operates a second
near-infrared spectrograph at the 2.5 m du Pont Telescope at Las
Campanas Observatory, with observations beginning in early 2017.
Observations at both facilities are scheduled to continue through 2020.
In keeping with previous SDSS policy, SDSS-IV provides regularly
scheduled public data releases; the first one, Data Release 13, was made

astigmatism corrector, and one of a pair of interchangeable highly aspheric correctors near the focal plane, one for imaging and the other for spectroscopy. The final focal ratio is f/5. The telescope is instrumented by a wide-area, multiband CCD camera and a pair of
fiber-fed double spectrographs. Novel features of the telescope include the following: (1) A 3° diameter (0.65 m) focal plane that has
excellent image quality and small geometric distortions over a wide wavelength range (3000-10,600 Å) in the imaging mode, and good
image quality combined with very small lateral and longitudinal color errors in the spectroscopic mode. The unusual requirement of very low distortion is set by the demands of time-delay-and-integrate (TDI) imaging. (2) Very high precision motion to support open-loop TDI observations. (3) A unique wind baffle/enclosure construction to maximize image quality and minimize construction costs. The telescope had first light in 1998 May and began regular survey operations in 2000.},

FLAMINGOS on the KPNO 2.1 m and 4 m telescopes, we have obtained spectra

from {\textasciitilde}M1 to later than M8 with typical classification errors of 0.5-1

place these objects on the H-R diagram and use pre-main-sequence
evolutionary models to infer masses and ages. The mean age for this
low-mass population of NGC 2024 is 0.5 Myr, and derived masses range
from {\textasciitilde}0.7 to 0.02 Msolar with 23 objects falling below the
hydrogen-burning limit. The logarithmic mass function rises to a peak at
{\textasciitilde}0.2 Msolar before turning over and declining into the
substellar regime. There is a possible secondary peak at {\textasciitilde}0.035
Msolar however, the errors are also consistent with a flat
IMF in this region. The ratio of brown dwarfs to stars is similar to
that found in the Trapezium but roughly twice the ratio found in IC 348,
leading us to conclude that the substellar IMF in young clusters may be
dependent on the local star-forming environment.},

	abstract = {Low-mass stars (0.1 {\textless}{\textasciitilde} M {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 1 solar mass) in OB associations are key to addressing some of the most fundamental problems in star
formation. The low-mass stellar populations of OB associations provide a snapshot of the fossil star-formation record of giant molecular cloud complexes. Large-scale surveys have identified hundreds of members of nearby OB associations, and revealed that low-mass stars exist wherever high-mass stars have recently formed. The spatial distribution of low-mass members of OB associations demonstrate the existence of significant substructure ("subgroups"). This "discretized" sequence of stellar groups is consistent with an origin in short-lived parent molecular clouds within a giant molecular cloud complex. The lowmass population in each subgroup within an OB association exhibits little evidence for significant age spreads on timescales of {\textasciitilde}10 m.y. or greater, in agreement with a scenario of rapid star formation and cloud dissipation. The initial mass function (IMF) of the stellar populations in OB associations in the mass range 0.1 {\textless}{\textasciitilde} M {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 1 solar mass is largely consistent with the field IMF, and most low-mass
pre-main-sequence stars in the solar vicinity are in OB associations. These findings agree with early suggestions that the majority of stars in the galaxy were born in OB associations. The most recent work further suggests that a significant fraction of the stellar population may have their origin in the more spread out regions of OB associations, instead of all being born in dense clusters. Groundbased and spacebased (Spitzer Space Telescope) infrared studies have provided robust evidence that primordial accretion disks around low-mass stars dissipate on timescales of a few million years. However, on close inspection there appears to be great variance in the disk dissipation timescales for stars of a given mass in OB associations. While some stars appear to lack disks at {\textasciitilde}1 m.y., a few appear to retain accretion disks up to ages of {\textasciitilde}10-20 m.y.},

Our focus is mapping and characterizing the off-cloud, low-mass, pre-main-sequence (PMS) populations. We report 2062 K- and M-type confirmed T Tauri members; 59\% are located in the OB1a subassociation, 27\% in the OB1b subassociation, and the remaining 14\% in the A and B molecular clouds. We characterize two new clusterings of T Tauri stars, the HD 35762 and HR 1833 groups, both located in OB1a not far from the 25 Ori cluster. We also identify two stellar overdensities in OB1b, containing 231 PMS stars, and find that the OB1b region is composed of two populations at different distances, possibly due to the OB1a subassociation overlapping with the front of OB1b. A ̃2 deg wide halo of young stars surrounds the Orion Nebula Cluster, corresponding in part to the low-mass populations of NGC 1977 and NGC 1980. We use the strength of Hα in emission, combined with the IR excess and optical variability, to define a new type of T Tauri star, the C/W class, stars we propose may be nearing the end of their accretion phase, in an evolutionary state between classical and weak-lined T Tauri stars. The evolution of the ensemble-wide equivalent width of Li I λ6707 indicates a Li depletion timescale of ̃8.5 Myr. Disk accretion declines with an e-folding timescale of ̃2 Myr, consistent with previous studies.

	abstract = {For stars with unresolved companions, motions of the centre of light and that of mass decouple, causing a single-source astrometric model to perform poorly. We show that such stars can be easily detected with the reduced chi2 statistic, or RUWE, provided as part of Gaia DR2. We convert RUWE into the amplitude of the image centroid wobble, which, if scaled by the source distance, is proportional to the physical separation between companions (for periods up to several years). We test this idea on a sample of known spectroscopic binaries and demonstrate that the amplitude of the centroid perturbation scales with the binary period and the mass ratio as expected. We apply this technique to the Gaia DR2 data and show how the binary fraction evolves across the Hertzsprung--Russell diagram. The observed incidence of unresolved companions is high for massive young stars and drops steadily with stellar mass, reaching its lowest levels for white dwarfs. We highlight the elevated binary fraction for the nearby Blue Stragglers and Blue Horizontal Branch stars. We also illustrate how unresolved hierarchical triples inflate the relative velocity signal in wide binaries. Finally, we point out a hint of evidence for the existence of additional companions to the hosts of extrasolar hot jupiters.},

We refer to this stellar aggregate as the 25 Orionis group. The group also harbors the Herbig Ae/Be star V346 Ori and a dozen other early-type stars with photometry, parallaxes, and some with IR excess emission, indicative of group membership. The number of high- and low-mass stars is in agreement with expectations from a standard initial mass function. The velocity distribution for the low-mass stars shows a narrow peak at 19.7 km s-1, offset {\textasciitilde}-10 km s-1 from the velocity characterizing the younger stars of the Ori OB1b subassociation, and -4 km s-1 from the velocity of widely spread young stars of the Ori OB1a population; this result provides new and compelling evidence that the 25 Ori group is a distinct kinematic entity, and that considerable space and velocity structure is present in the Ori OB1a subassociation. The low-mass members follow a well-defined band in the color-magnitude diagram, consistent with an isochronal age of {\textasciitilde}7-10 Myr. The {\textasciitilde}2 time drop in the overall Li I equivalent widths and accretion fraction between the younger Ori OB1b and the 25 Ori group is consistent with the latter being significantly older. In a simple-minded kinematic evolution scenario, the 25 Ori group may represent the evolved counterpart of the younger σ Ori cluster. The 25 Ori stellar aggregate is the most
populous {\textasciitilde}10 Myr sample yet known within 500 pc, setting it as an excellent laboratory to study the evolution of solar-like stars and protoplanetary disks.

Orion OB1 association, carried out with the QUEST camera at the
Venezuela National Astronomical Observatory. We identify for the first
time the widely spread low-mass, young population in the Ori OB1a and
OB1b subassociations. Candidate members were picked up by their
variability in the V band and position in color-magnitude diagrams. We
obtained spectra to confirm membership. In a region spanning {\textasciitilde}68
deg2, we found 197 new young stars; of these, 56 are located
in the Ori OB1a subassociation and 141 in Ori OB1b. The spatial
distribution of the low-mass young stars is spatially coincident with
that of the high-mass members but suggests a much sharper edge to the
association. Comparison with the spatial extent of molecular gas and
extinction maps indicates that the subassociation Ori OB1b is
concentrated within a ringlike structure of radius {\textasciitilde}2°({\textasciitilde}15 pc at 440
pc), centered roughly on the star ɛ Ori in the Orion belt. The
ring is apparent in 13CO and corresponds to a region with an
extinction AV{\textgreater}=1. The stars exhibiting strong Hα
emission, an indicator of active accretion, are found along this ring,
whereas the center is populated with weak Hα-emitting stars. In
contrast, Ori OB1a is located in a region devoid of gas and dust. We
identify a grouping of stars within a {\textasciitilde}3 deg2 area located in
Ori OB1a, roughly clustered around the B2 star 25 Ori. The Herbig Ae/Be
star V346 Ori is also associated with this grouping, which could be an
older analog of σ Ori. Using several sets of evolutionary tracks,
we find an age of 7-10 Myr for Ori OB1a and of {\textasciitilde}4-6 Myr for Ori OB1b,
consistent with previous estimates from OB stars. Indicators such as the
equivalent width of Hα and near-IR excesses show that the number
of accreting low-mass stars decreases sharply between Ori OB1b and Ori
OB1a. These results indicate that although a substantial fraction of
accreting disks remain at ages {\textasciitilde}5 Myr, inner disks are essentially
dissipated by 10 Myr.

Results: In addition to the photometric quality assessment, we present the best estimates of the three photometric passbands. Various colour-colour transformations are also derived to enable the users to convert between the Gaia and commonly used passbands. Conclusions: The internal analysis of the data shows that the photometric calibrations can reach a precision as low as 2 mmag on individual CCD measurements.

association. These dimming events are variable in depth, duration, and morphology. High spatial resolution imaging revealed that the star is single and radial velocity monitoring indicated that the dimming events cannot be due to an eclipsing stellar or brown dwarf companion. Archival and follow-up photometry suggest the dimming events are transient in nature. The variable morphology of the dimming events suggests they are not due to a single spherical body. The ingress of each dimming event is always shallower than egress, as one would expect for an orbiting body with a leading tail. The dimming events are periodic and synchronous with the stellar rotation. However, we argue it is unlikely the dimming events could be attributed to anything on the stellar surface based on the observed depths and durations. Variable obscuration by a
protoplanetary disk is unlikely on the basis that the star is not actively accreting and lacks the infrared excess associated with an inner disk. Rather, we explore the possibilities that the dimming events are due to magnetospheric clouds, a transiting protoplanet surrounded by circumplanetary dust and debris, eccentric orbiting bodies undergoing periodic tidal disruption, or an extended field of dust or debris near the corotation radius.},

The phased LCs have a variety of shapes which can be attributed to physical causes ranging from stellar pulsation and stellar rotation to disk-related phenomena. We identify and discuss a number of observed behaviors. The periods are ̃0.2-30 days with a peak near 2 days and the rapid period end nearing breakup velocity. M stars in the young USco region rotate systematically faster than GK stars, a pattern also present in K2 data for the older Pleiades and Praesepe systems. At higher masses (types FGK), the well-defined period-color relationship for slowly rotating stars seen in the Pleiades and Praesepe systems is not yet present in USco. Circumstellar disks are present predominantly among the more slowly rotating M stars in USco, with few disks in the subday rotators. However, M dwarfs with disks rotate faster on average than FGK systems with disks. For four of these disked M dwarfs, we provide direct evidence for disk locking based on the K2 LC morphologies. Our preliminary analysis shows a relatively mass-independent spin-up by a factor of ̃3.5 between USco and the Pleiades, then mass-dependent spin-down between Pleiades and Praesepe.},

Many of these K2 targets show two distinct periods, and for the lowest-mass stars in these clusters, virtually all of these systems with two periods are photometric binaries. The most likely explanation is that we are detecting the rotation periods for both components of these binaries. We explore the evolution of the rotation rate in both components of photometric binaries relative to one another and to nonphotometric binary stars. In Upper Sco and the Pleiades, these low-mass binary stars have periods that are much shorter on average and much closer to each other than would be true if drawn at random from the M dwarf single stars. In Upper Sco, this difference correlates strongly with the presence or absence of infrared excesses due to primordial circumstellar disks—the single-star population includes many stars with disks, and their rotation periods are distinctively longer on average than their binary star cousins of the same mass. By Praesepe age, the significance of the difference in rotation rate between the single and binary low-mass M dwarf stars is much less, suggesting that angular momentum loss from winds for fully convective zero-age main-sequence stars erases memory of the rotation rate dichotomy for binary and single very low mass stars at later ages.},

members of the young (\${\textbackslash}sim\$3 Myr) Taurus association, in addition to an older
(\${\textbackslash}sim\$30 Myr) population of stars that is largely in the foreground of the
Taurus molecular clouds. Out of 156 of the highest-confidence Taurus members,
we find that 81{\textbackslash}\% are periodic. Our sample of young foreground stars is biased
and incomplete, but nearly all (37/38) are periodic. The overall distribution
of rotation rates as a function of color (a proxy for mass) is similar to that
found in other clusters: the slowest rotators are among the early M spectral
types, with faster rotation towards both earlier FGK and later M types. The
relationship between period and color/mass exhibited by older clusters such as
the Pleiades is already in place by Taurus age. The foreground population has
very few stars, but is consistent with the USco and Pleiades period
distributions. As found in other young clusters, stars with disks rotate on
average slower, and few with disks are found rotating faster than \${\textbackslash}sim\$2 d.
The overall amplitude of the light curves decreases with age and higher mass
stars have generally lower amplitudes than lower mass stars. Stars with disks
have on average larger amplitudes than stars without disks, though the physical
mechanisms driving the variability and the resulting light curve morphologies
are also different between these two classes.},

The optical/infrared colors of CVSO30c are indicative of a stellar, not
substellar object, while the object’s color-magnitude

low-mass member of 25 Ori. Broadband photometry for CVSO30c is instead
better fit by contaminants such as a background K3 giant or M subdwarf.

	abstract = {Context. Direct imaging has developed into a very successful technique 
for the detection of exoplanets in wide orbits, especially around young
stars. Directly imaged planets can be both followed astrometrically on
their orbits and observed spectroscopically and thus provide an
essential tool for our understanding of the early solar system. 
Aims: We surveyed the 25 Ori association for direct-imaging companions.
This association has an age of only few million years. Among other
targets, we observed CVSO 30, which has recently been identified as the
first T Tauri star found to host a transiting planet candidate. 
Methods: We report on photometric and spectroscopic high-contrast
observations with the Very Large Telescope, the Keck telescopes, and the
Calar Alto observatory. They reveal a directly imaged planet candidate
close to the young M3 star CVSO 30. Results: The JHK-band
photometry of the newly identified candidate is at better than 1σ
consistent with late-type giants, early-T and early-M dwarfs, and
free-floating planets. Other hypotheses such as galaxies can be excluded
at more than 3.5σ. A lucky imaging z' photometric detection limit
z' = 20.5 mag excludes early-M dwarfs and results in less than 10
MJup for CVSO 30 c if bound. We present spectroscopic
observations of the wide companion that imply that the only remaining
explanation for the object is that it is the first very young ({\textless}10
Myr) L - T-type planet bound to a star, meaning that it appears bluer
than expected as a result of a decreasing cloud opacity at low effective
temperatures. Only a planetary spectral model is consistent with the
spectroscopy, and we deduce a best-fit mass of 4-5 Jupiter masses (total
range 0.6-10.2 Jupiter masses). Conclusions: This means that CVSO
30 is the first system in which both a close-in and a wide planet
candidate are found to have a common host star. The orbits of the two
possible planets could not be more different: they have orbital periods
of 10.76 h and about 27 000 yr. The two orbits may have formed during a
mutual catastrophic event of planet-planet scattering.

Using a spherical harmonic-based reflection model developed as an extension of the STARRY package, we are able to reconstruct the surface features of this rocky world. We recover a time-variable albedo map of the planet including persistent regions which we interpret as oceans and cloud banks indicative of continental features. We argue that this planet represents the most promising detection of a habitable world to date, although the potential intelligence of any life on it is yet to be determined.},

	abstract = {The field of visible-light continuous time series photometry is now at its golden age, manifested by the continuum of past (CoRoT, Kepler), present (K2), and future (TESS, PLATO) space-based surveys delivering high precision data with a long baseline for a large number of stars. The availability of the high-quality data has enabled astrophysical studies not possible before, including, for example, detailed
asteroseismic investigations and the study of the exoplanet census including small planets. This has also allowed to study the minute photometric variability following the orbital motion in stellar binaries and star-planet systems which is the subject of this review. We focus on systems with a main sequence primary and a low-mass secondary, from a small star to a massive planet. The orbital modulations are induced by a combination of gravitational and atmospheric processes, including the beaming effect, tidal ellipsoidal distortion, reflected light, and thermal emission. Therefore, the phase curve shape contains information about the companion’s mass and atmospheric characteristics, making phase curves a useful astrophysical tool. For example, phase curves can be used to detect and measure the mass of short-period low-mass
companions orbiting hot fast-rotating stars out of reach of other detection methods. Another interesting application of phase curves is using the orbital phase modulations to look for non-transiting systems, which comprise the majority of stellar binary and star-planet systems. We discuss the science done with phase curves, the first results obtained so far, and the current difficulties and open questions related to this young and evolving subfield.},

	abstract = {The Gibbs sampler, the algorithm of Metropolis and similar iterative simulation methods are potentially very helpful for summarizing multivariate distributions. Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

In addition to advantages of the Lomb–Scargle method such as treatment of non-uniform sampling and heteroscedastic errors, the multiband periodogram significantly improves period finding for randomly sampled multiband light curves (e.g., Pan-STARRS, DES, and LSST). The light curves in each band are modeled as arbitrary truncated Fourier series, with the period and phase shared across all bands. The key aspect is the use of Tikhonov regularization which drives most of the variability into the so-called base model common to all bands, while fits for individual bands describe residuals relative to the base model and typically require lower-order Fourier series. This decrease in the effective model complexity is the main reason for improved performance. After a pedagogical development of the formalism of least-squares spectral analysis, which motivates the essential features of the multiband model, we use simulated light curves and randomly subsampled SDSS Stripe 82 data to demonstrate the superiority of this method compared to other methods from the literature and find that this method will be able to efficiently determine the correct period in the majority of LSST’s bright RR Lyrae stars with as little as six months of LSST data, a vast improvement over the years of data reported to be required by previous studies. A Python implementation of this method, along with code to fully reproduce the results reported here, is available on GitHub.},

Previous work by van Eyken et al. and Barnes et al. predicts that the stellar rotation axis and the planetary orbital plane should precess with a period of 300–600 days. As a consequence, the observed transits should change shape and depth, disappear, and reappear with the precession. Our observations indicate the long-term presence of the transit events ( years), and that the transits indeed do change depth, disappear and reappear. The Spitzer observations and the NIRSPEC radial velocity observations (with contemporaneous LCOGT optical light curve data) are consistent with the predicted transit times and depths for the precession model and demonstrate the disappearance of the transits. An LCOGT optical light curve shows that the transits do reappear approximately 1 year later. The observed transits occur at the times predicted by a straight-forward propagation of the transit ephemeris. The precession model correctly predicts the depth and time of the Spitzer transit and the lack of a transit at the time of the NIRSPEC radial velocity observations. However, the precession model predicts the return of the transits approximately 1 month later than observed by LCOGT. Overall, the data are suggestive that the planetary interpretation of the observed transit events may indeed be correct, but the precession model and data are currently insufficient to confirm firmly the planetary status of PTFO 8-8695b.},

We find that the unusual lightcurve shapes of PTFO 8-8695 can be explained by transits of a planet across an oblate, gravity-darkened stellar disk. We develop a theoretical framework for understanding precession of a planetary orbit's ascending node for the case when the stellar rotational angular momentum and the planetary orbital angular momentum are comparable in magnitude. We then implement those ideas to simultaneously and self-consistently fit two separate lightcurves observed in 2009 December and 2010 December. Our two self-consistent fits yield M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 3.0 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 3.6 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} for assumed stellar masses of M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.34 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.44 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} respectively. The two fits have precession periods of 293 days and 581 days. These mass determinations (consistent with previous upper limits) along with the strength of the gravity-darkened precessing model together validate PTFO 8-8695b as just the second hot Jupiter known to orbit an M-dwarf. Our fits show a high degree of spin-orbit misalignment in the PTFO 8-8695 system: 69° ± 2° or 73.°1 ± 0.°5, in the two cases. The large misalignment is consistent with the hypothesis that planets become hot Jupiters with random orbital plane alignments early in a system's lifetime. We predict that as a result of the highly misaligned, precessing system, the transits should disappear for months at a time over the course of the system's precession period. The precessing, gravity-darkened model also predicts other observable effects: changing orbit inclination that could be detected by radial velocity observations, changing stellar inclination that would manifest as varying vsin i, changing projected spin-orbit alignment that could be seen by the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, changing transit shapes over the course of the precession, and differing lightcurves as a function of wavelength. Our measured planet radii of 1.64 R {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and 1.68 R {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} in each case are consistent with a young, hydrogen-dominated planet that results from a "hot-start" formation mechanism.},

Transient Factory (PTF) Orion project. It has a photometric transit
period of 0.448413 ± 0.000040 days, and appears in both 2009 and
2010 PTF data. Follow-up low-precision radial velocity (RV) observations
and adaptive optics imaging suggest that the star is not an eclipsing
binary, and that it is unlikely that a background source is blended with
the target and mimicking the observed transit. RV observations with the
Hobby-Eberly and Keck telescopes yield an RV that has the same period as
the photometric event, but is offset in phase from the transit center by
≈ - 0.22 periods. The amplitude (half range) of the RV variations is
2.4 km s-1 and is comparable with the expected RV amplitude
that stellar spots could induce. The RV curve is likely dominated by
stellar spot modulation and provides an upper limit to the projected
companion mass of M psin i orb {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 4.8 ±
1.2 M Jup; when combined with the orbital inclination, i
orb, of the candidate planet from modeling of the transit
light curve, we find an upper limit on the mass of the planetary
candidate of M p {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 5.5 ± 1.4 M Jup.
This limit implies that the planet is orbiting close to, if not inside,
its Roche limiting orbital radius, so that it may be undergoing active
mass loss and evaporation.},

	abstract = {The T Tauri star PTFO 8-8695 exhibits periodic fading events that have been interpreted as the transits of a giant planet on a precessing orbit. Here we present three tests of the planet hypothesis. First, we sought evidence for the secular changes in light-curve morphology that are predicted to be a consequence of orbital precession. We observed 28 fading events spread over several years and did not see the expected changes. Instead, we found that the fading events are not strictly periodic. Second, we attempted to detect the planet's radiation, based on infrared observations spanning the predicted times of occultations. We ruled out a signal of the expected amplitude. Third, we attempted to detect the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect by performing high-resolution spectroscopy throughout a fading event. No effect was seen at the expected level, ruling out most (but not all) possible orientations for the hypothetical planetary orbit. Our spectroscopy also revealed strong, time-variable, high-velocity Hα and Ca H \& K emission features. All these observations cast doubt on the planetary hypothesis, and suggest instead that the fading events represent starspots, eclipses by circumstellar dust, or occultations of an accretion hotspot.},

The inner companion, CVSO 30 b, is the first possible young transiting planet orbiting a previously known weak-lined T Tauri star. With five telescopes of the `Young Exoplanet Transit Initiative' located in Asia, Europe and South America, we monitored CVSO 30 over three years in a total of 144 nights and detected 33 fading events. In two more seasons we carried out follow-up
observations with three telescopes. We can confirm that there is a change in the shape of the fading event between different observations and that the fading event even disappears and reappears. A total of 38 fading event light curves were simultaneously modelled. We derived the planetary, stellar and geometrical properties of the system and found them slightly smaller but in agreement with the values from the
discovery paper. The period of the fading event was found to be 1.36 s shorter and 100 times more precise than the previous published value. If CVSO 30 b would be a giant planet on a precessing orbit, which we cannot confirm, yet, the precession period may be shorter than previously thought. But if confirmed as a planet it would be the youngest
transiting planet ever detected and will provide important constraints on planet formation and migration time-scales.},

host stars, located at distances closer than about 500 pc around the
Sun. In total, 176 binaries, 27 hierarchical triples, and one
hierarchical quadruple system are detected among more than 1300
exoplanet host stars, whose multiplicity is investigated, yielding a
multiplicity rate of the exoplanet host stars of at least about 15 per
cent. The detected companions and the exoplanet host stars are
equidistant and share a common proper motion, as it is expected for
gravitationally bound stellar systems, proven with their accurate Gaia
astrometry. The companions exhibit masses in the range between about
0.078 and 1.4 M⊙ with a peak in their mass distribution
between 0.15 and 0.3 M\_\{⊙\}. The companions are separated from the
exoplanet host stars by about 20 up to 9100 au, but are found most
frequently within a projected separation of 1000 au. While most of the
detected companions are early M dwarfs, eight white dwarf companions of
exoplanet host stars are also identified in this survey, whose true
nature is revealed with their photometric properties. Hence, these
degenerated companions and the exoplanet host stars form evolved stellar
systems with exoplanets, which have survived (physically but also
dynamically) the post-main-sequence evolution of their former primary
star.},

specifically in multiple stellar systems. In such systems, stellar
companions may have a profound influence on gas giant planet formation

perturbation. We select 84 Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) with gas
giant planet candidates. We obtain high-angular resolution images using
telescopes with adaptive optics (AO) systems. Together with the AO data,
we use archival radial velocity data and dynamical analysis to constrain
the presence of stellar companions. We detect 59 stellar companions
around 40 KOIs for which we develop methods of testing their physical
association. These methods are based on color information and galactic
stellar population statistics. We find evidence of suppressive planet
formation within 20 AU by comparing stellar multiplicity. The stellar
multiplicity rate (MR) for planet host stars is
\{0\}-0+5\% within 20 AU. In comparison, the stellar
MR is 18\% ± 2\% for the control sample, i.e., field stars in the
solar neighborhood. The stellar MR for planet host stars is 34\% ±
8\% for separations between 20 and 200 AU, which is higher than the

comparable between planet host stars and the control sample. We discuss

	abstract = {Almost half of the stellar systems in the solar neighborhood are made up 
of multiple stars. In multiple-star systems, planet formation is under
the dynamical influence of stellar companions, and the planet occurrence
rate is expected to be different from that of single stars. There have
been numerous studies on the planet occurrence rate of single star
systems. However, to fully understand planet formation, the planet
occurrence rate in multiple-star systems needs to be addressed. In this
work, we infer the planet occurrence rate in multiple-star systems by
measuring the stellar multiplicity rate for planet host stars. For a
subsample of 56 Kepler planet host stars, we use adaptive optics (AO)
imaging and the radial velocity (RV) technique to search for stellar
companions. The combination of these two techniques results in high
search completeness for stellar companions. We detect 59 visual stellar
companions to 25 planet host stars with AO data. Three stellar
companions are within 2'' and 27 within 6''. We also detect two possible
stellar companions (KOI 5 and KOI 69) showing long-term RV acceleration.
After correcting for a bias against planet detection in multiple-star
systems due to flux contamination, we find that planet formation is
suppressed in multiple-star systems with separations smaller than 1500
AU. Specifically, we find that compared to single star systems, planets
in multiple-star systems occur 4.5 ± 3.2, 2.6 ± 1.0, and
1.7 ± 0.5 times less frequently when a stellar companion is
present at a distance of 10, 100, and 1000 AU, respectively. This
conclusion applies only to circumstellar planets; the planet occurrence
rate for circumbinary planets requires further investigation.},

	abstract = {It is well established that roughly half of all nearby solar-type stars have at least one companion. Stellar companions can have significant implications for the detection and characterization of exoplanets, including triggering false positives and masking the true radii of planets. Determining the fraction of exoplanet host stars that are also binaries allows us to better determine planetary characteristics as well as establish the relationship between binarity and planet formation. Using high angular resolution speckle imaging, we detect stellar companions within ∼1 arcsec of K2 planet-candidate host stars. Comparing our detected companion rate to TRILEGAL star count simulations and known detection limits of speckle imaging, we estimate the binary fraction of K2 planet host stars to be 40\%–50\%, similar to that of Kepler exoplanet hosts and field stars.},

	abstract = {The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is finding transiting planet candidates around bright, nearby stars across the entire sky. The large field of view, however, results in low spatial resolution; therefore, multiple stars contribute to almost every TESS light curve. High angular resolution imaging can detect the previously unknown companions to planetary candidate hosts that dilute the transit depths, lead to host star ambiguity, and, in some cases, are the source of false-positive transit signals. We use speckle imaging on the Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) telescope to search for companions to 542 TESS planet candidate hosts in the southern sky. We provide correction factors for the 117 systems with resolved companions due to photometric contamination. The contamination in TESS due to close binaries is similar to that found in surveys of Kepler planet candidates. For the solar-type population, we find a deep deficit of close binary systems with projected stellar separations less than 100 au among planet candidate hosts (44 observed binaries compared to 124 expected based on field binary statistics). The close binary suppression among TESS planet candidate hosts is similar to that seen for the more distant Kepler population. We also find a large surplus of TESS planet candidates in wide binary systems detected in both SOAR and Gaia DR2 (119 observed binaries compared to 77 expected). These wide binaries almost
exclusively host giant planets, however, suggesting that orbital migration caused by perturbations from the stellar companion may lead to planet–planet scattering and suppress the population of small
planets in wide binaries. Both trends are also apparent in the M dwarf planet candidate hosts.},

	abstract = {Stellar companions can influence the formation and evolution of 
planetary systems, but there are currently few observational constraints
on the properties of planet-hosting binary star systems. We search for
stellar companions around 77 transiting hot Jupiter systems to explore
the statistical properties of this population of companions as compared
to field stars of similar spectral type. After correcting for survey
incompleteness, we find that 47 \% +/- 7 \% of hot Jupiter systems have
stellar companions with semimajor axes between 50 and 2000 au. This is
2.9 times larger than the field star companion fraction in this
separation range, with a significance of 4.4σ . In the 1-50
au range, only \{3.9\}-2.0+4.5 \% of hot Jupiters
host stellar companions, compared to the field star value of 16.4 \% +/-
0.7 \% , which is a 2.7σ difference. We find that the distribution
of mass ratios for stellar companions to hot Jupiter systems peaks at
small values and therefore differs from that of field star binaries
which tend to be uniformly distributed across all mass ratios. We
conclude that either wide separation stellar binaries are more favorable
sites for gas giant planet formation at all separations, or that the
presence of stellar companions preferentially causes the inward
migration of gas giant planets that formed farther out in the disk via
dynamical processes such as Kozai-Lidov oscillations. We determine
that less than 20\% of hot Jupiters have stellar companions capable of
inducing Kozai-Lidov oscillations assuming initial semimajor axes
between 1 and 5 au, implying that the enhanced companion occurrence is
likely correlated with environments where gas giants can form
efficiently.},

	abstract = {Close binaries suppress the formation of circumstellar (S-type) planets and therefore significantly bias the inferred planet occurrence rates and statistical trends. After compiling various radial velocity and high-resolution imaging surveys, we determine that binaries with a {\textless} 1 au fully suppress S-type planets, binaries with a = 10 au host close planets at 15\% the occurrence rate of single stars, and wide binaries with a {\textgreater} 200 au have a negligible effect on planet formation. We show that F = 43\% +/- 6\% of solar-type primaries do not host close planets due to suppression by close stellar companions. By removing spectroscopic binaries from their samples, radial velocity surveys for giant planets boost their detection rates by a factor of 1/(1-F) = 1.8 +/- 0.2 compared to transiting surveys. This selection bias fully accounts for the discrepancy in hot Jupiter occurrence rates inferred from these two detection methods. Correcting for both planet suppression by close binaries and transit dilution by wide binaries, the occurrence rate of small planets orbiting single G-dwarfs is 2.1 +/- 0.3 times larger than the rate inferred from all G-dwarfs in the Kepler survey. About half (but not all) of the observed increase in small, short-period planets toward low-mass hosts can be explained by the corresponding decrease in the binary fraction. Finally, we demonstrate that the apparent enhancement of wide stellar companions to hot Jupiter hosts is due to multiple selection effects. Although very close binaries with secondary masses M\_2 {\textgreater} 10 M\_J preferentially have wide tertiary companions, genuine hot Jupiters with M\_p = 0.2-4 M\_J that formed via core accretion do not exhibit a statistically significant excess of wide stellar companions.},

This is likely to induce a secular oscillation in the eccentricity of the inner WJ that brings its periastron close enough to the host star for tidal star-planet interactions to be significant. In the Kepler-448 system, the mutual inclination is weakly constrained, and such an eccentricity oscillation is possible for a fraction of the solutions. Thus these WJs may be undergoing tidal migration to become hot Jupiters (HJs), although the migration via this process from beyond the snow line is disfavored by the close-in and massive nature of the companions. This may indicate that WJs can be formed in situ and could even evolve into HJs via high-eccentricity migration inside the snow line.},

We develop a joint analysis of multi-colour photometry, centroids, radial velocity (RV) cross-correlation function (CCF) profiles and their bisector inverse slopes (BIS) to disentangle this three-body system. Data from the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS), SPECULOOS and HARPS are analysed and modelled with our new blendfitter software. We find that the binary consists of NGTS-3A (G6V-dwarf) and NGTS-3B (K1V-dwarf) at {\textless}1 arcsec separation. NGTS-3Ab orbits every P = 1.675 days. The planet radius and mass are R\_planet = 1.48+-0.37 R\_J and M\_planet = 2.38+-0.26 M\_J, suggesting it is potentially inflated. We emphasise that only combining all the information from multi-colour photometry, centroids and RV CCF profiles can resolve systems like NGTS-3. Such systems cannot be disentangled from single-colour photometry and RV measurements alone. Importantly, the presence of a BIS correlation indicates a blend scenario, but is not sufficient to determine which star is orbited by the third body. Moreover, even if no BIS correlation is detected, a blend scenario cannot be ruled out without further information. The choice of methodology for calculating the BIS can influence the measured significance of its correlation. The presented findings are crucial to consider for wide-field transit surveys, which require wide CCD pixels ({\textgreater}5 arcsec) and are prone to contamination by blended objects. With TESS on the horizon, it is pivotal for the candidate vetting to incorporate all available follow-up information from multi-colour photometry and RV CCF profiles.},

The orbit of HAT-P-11b is misaligned with the star’s spin—one of the few known cases of a misaligned planet orbiting a star less massive than the Sun. We find an additional planet in the system based on a decade of precision radial velocity (RV) measurements from Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer. HAT-P-11c is similar to Jupiter in its mass ( M J ) and orbital period ( year), but has a much more eccentric orbit (e = 0.60 ± 0.03). In our joint modeling of RV and stellar activity, we found an activity-induced RV signal of ∼7 , consistent with other active K dwarfs, but significantly smaller than the 31 reflex motion due to HAT-P-11c. We investigated the dynamical coupling between HAT-P-11b and c as a possible explanation for HAT-P-11b’s misaligned orbit, finding that planet–planet Kozai interactions cannot tilt planet b’s orbit due to general relativistic precession; however, nodal precession operating on million year timescales is a viable mechanism to explain HAT-P-11b’s high obliquity. This leaves open the question of why HAT-P-11c may have such a tilted orbit. At a distance of 38 pc, the HAT-P-11 system offers rich opportunities for further exoplanet characterization through astrometry and direct imaging.},

	abstract = {Theoretical calculations and some indirect observations show that 
massive exoplanets on tight orbits must decay due to tidal dissipation
within their host stars. This orbital evolution could be observationally
accessible through precise transit timing over a course of decades. The
rate of planetary in-spiraling may not only help us to understand some
aspects of evolution of planetary systems, but also can be used as a
probe of the stellar internal structure. In this paper we present
results of transit timing campaigns organized for a carefully selected
sample of the Northern hemisphere hot Jupiter-like planets which were
found to be the best candidates for detecting planet-star tidal
interactions. Among them, there is the WASP-12 system which is the best
candidate for possessing an in-falling giant exoplanet. Our new
observations support the scenario of orbital decay of WASP-12 b and
allow us to refine its rate. The derived tidal quality parameter of the
host star Q'*=(1.82±0.32)×105 is in
agreement with theoretical predictions for subgiant stars. For the
remaining systems - HAT-P-23, KELT-1, KELT-16, WASP-33, and WASP-103 -
our transit timing data reveal no deviations from the constant-period
models, hence constraints on the individual rates of orbital decay were
placed. The tidal quality parameters of host stars in at least four
systems - HAT-P-23, KELT-1, WASP-33, and WASP-103 - were found to be
greater than the value reported for WASP-12. This is in line with the
finding that those hosts are main sequence stars, for which efficiency
of tidal dissipation is predicted to be relatively weak.},

	abstract = {Many problems in contemporary astrophysics---from understanding the formation of black holes to untangling the chemical evolution of galaxies---rely on knowledge about binary stars. This, in turn, depends on discovery and characterization of binary companions for large numbers of different kinds of stars in different chemical and dynamical environments. Current stellar spectroscopic surveys observe hundreds of thousands to millions of stars with (typically) few observational epochs, which allows binary discovery but makes orbital characterization challenging. We use a custom Monte Carlo sampler (The Joker) to perform discovery and characterization of binary systems through radial-velocities, in the regime of sparse, noisy, and poorly sampled multi-epoch data. We use it to generate posterior samplings in Keplerian parameters for 232,531 sources released in APOGEE Data Release 16. Our final catalog contains 19,635 high-confidence close-binary (P {\textless} few years, a {\textless} few AU) systems that show interesting relationships between binary occurrence rate and location in the color-magnitude diagram. We find notable faint companions at high masses (black-hole candidates), at low masses (substellar candidates), and at very close separations (mass-transfer candidates). We also use the posterior samplings in a (toy) hierarchical inference to measure the long-period binary-star eccentricity distribution. We release the full set of posterior samplings for the entire parent sample of 232,531 stars. This set of samplings involves no heuristic "discovery" threshold and therefore can be used for myriad statistical purposes, including hierarchical inferences about binary-star populations and sub-threshold searches.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05942},
	abstract = {Context. The HARPS spectrograph provides state-of-the-art stellar radial velocity (RV) measurements with a precision down to 1 m/s. The spectra are extracted with a dedicated data-reduction software (DRS) and the RVs are computed by CCF with a numerical mask. Aims. The aim of this study is three-fold: (i) Create easy access to the public HARPS RV data set. (ii) Apply the new public SERVAL pipeline to the spectra, and produce a more precise RV data set. (iii) Check whether the precision of the RVs can be further improved by correcting for small nightly systematic effects. Methods. For each star observed with HARPS, we downloaded the publicly available spectra from the ESO archive and recomputed the RVs with SERVAL. We then computed nightly zero points (NZPs) by averaging the RVs of quiet stars. Results. Analysing the RVs of the most RV-quiet stars, whose RV scatter is {\textless} 5 m/s, we find that SERVAL RVs are on average more precise than DRS RVs by a few percent. We find three significant systematic effects, whose magnitude is independent of the software used for the RV derivation: (i) stochastic variations with a magnitude of 1 m/s; (ii) long-term variations, with a magnitude of 1 m/s and a typical timescale of a few weeks; and (iii) 20-30 NZPs significantly deviating by a few m/s. In addition, we find small ({\textless} 1 m/s) but significant intra-night drifts in DRS RVs before the 2015 intervention, and in SERVAL RVs after it. We confirm that the fibre exchange in 2015 caused a discontinuous RV jump, which strongly depends on the spectral type of the observed star: from 14 m/s for late F-type stars, to -3 m/s for M dwarfs. Conclusions. Our NZP-corrected SERVAL RVs can be retrieved from a user-friendly, public database. It provides more than 212 000 RVs for about 3000 stars along with many auxiliary information, NZP corrections, various activity indices, and DRS-CCF products.},

	abstract = {We present the results of a new series of nongray calculations of the atmospheres, spectra, colors, and evolution of extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) and brown dwarfs for effective temperatures below 1300 K. This theory encompasses most of the mass/age parameter space occupied by substellar objects and is the first spectral study down to 100 K. These calculations are in aid of the multitude of searches being conducted or planned around the world for giant planets and brown dwarfs and reveal the exotic nature of the class. Generically, absorption by H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} at longer wavelengths and H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}O opacity windows at shorter wavelengths conspire to redistribute flux blueward. Below 1200 K, methane is the dominant carbon bearing molecule and is a universal diagnostic feature of EGP and brown dwarf spectra. We find that the primary bands in which to search are Z ({\textasciitilde}1.05 μm), J ({\textasciitilde}1.2 μm), H ({\textasciitilde}1.6 μm), K ({\textasciitilde}2.2 μm), M ({\textasciitilde}5 μm), and N ({\textasciitilde}10 μm), that enhancements of the emergent flux over blackbody values, in particular in the near infrared, can be by many orders of magnitude, and that the infrared colors of EGPs and brown dwarfs are much bluer than previously believed. In particular, relative to J and H, the K band flux is reduced by CH{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}4{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} absorption. Furthermore, we conclude that for T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}'s below 1200 K most or all true metals may be sequestered below the photosphere, that an interior radiative zone is a generic feature of substellar objects, and that clouds of H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}O and NH{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}3{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} are formed for T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}'s below {\textasciitilde}400 and {\textasciitilde}200 K, respectively. This study is done for solar-metallicity objects in isolation and does not include the effects of stellar insulation. Nevertheless, it is a comprehensive attempt to bridge the gap between the planetary and stellar realms and to develop a nongray theory of objects from 0.3M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (``Saturn'') to 70M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ({\textasciitilde}0.07 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}).

that they lose orbital energy and angular momentum due to tidal

show that hot Jupiter host stars have a smaller Galactic velocity
dispersion than a similar population of stars without hot Jupiters.
Since Galactic velocity dispersion is correlated with age, this
observation implies that the population of hot Jupiter host stars is on
average younger than the field population. The best explanation for this
inference is that tidal interactions cause hot Jupiters to inspiral
while their host stars are on the main sequence. This observation
requires that the typical modified stellar tidal quality factor
\{Q\}* \{{\textbackslash}prime \} for solar-type stars is in the
range \{log\vphantom{\{}\}\}10\{Q\}* \{{\textbackslash}prime \}≲ 7.},

stars indicate the presence of companions in orbit around the primaries,
even though a complete spectroscopic orbital solution is not possible
because of the long periods. Some of these companions may have
substellar masses and are thus of considerable interest for the study of
the characteristics of extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs. Similar
indications can be obtained from the measurement of small astrometric
accelerations of the primary star, either from the ground or more likely
from future highly precise space astrometry missions. We show here that
a single measurement of the angular separation of such companions, if
they can be imaged directly, provides valuable statistical information
on their mass when combined with the accelerations. We derive the
probability distribution of the companion mass separately for the radial
velocity case and for the astrometric case by Monte Carlo simulations,
and illustrate the application of the technique with several examples.
The information on the masses of such wide substellar companions is
complementary to that from closer spectroscopic companions, and a full
analysis of the mass distribution of these objects should include both
to avoid possible biases.},

(HD 190406; GJ 779; 15 Sge). Three epochs of high-resolution imaging
using adaptive optics (AO) at the Gemini-North and Keck II Telescopes
demonstrate that HR 7672B is a common proper motion companion, with a
separation of 0.79" (14 AU) and a 2.16 μm flux ratio of 8.6 mag.
Using follow-up K-band spectroscopy from Keck AO+NIRSPEC, we measure a
spectral type of L45 with an uncertainty of +/-1.5 subclasses. This is
the closest ultracool companion around a main-sequence star found to
date by direct imaging. We estimate that the primary has an age of 1-3
Gyr. Assuming coevality, the companion is most likely substellar, with a
mass of 55-78 MJ based on theoretical models. The primary
star shows a long-term radial velocity trend, and we combine the radial
velocity data and AO imaging to set a firm (model-independent) lower
limit of 48 MJ. In contrast to the paucity of brown dwarf
companions at {\textless}{\textasciitilde}4 AU around FGK dwarfs, HR 7672B implies that brown
dwarf companions do exist at separations comparable to those of the
giant planets in our own solar system. Its presence is at variance with
scenarios in which brown dwarfs form as ejected stellar embryos.
Moreover, since HR 7672B is likely too massive to have formed in a
circumstellar disk as planets are believed to, its discovery suggests
that a diversity of physical processes act to populate the outer regions
of exoplanetary systems.},

This transition is coincident with a minimum in the occurrence rate of such objects, suggesting that the maximum mass of a celestial body formed through core accretion like a planet is less than . Consequently, objects with orbiting solar-type dwarf stars likely formed through gravitational instability and should not be thought of as planets. Theoretical models of giant planet formation in scaled minimum-mass solar nebula Shakura–Sunyaev disks with standard parameters tuned to produce giant planets predict a maximum mass nearly an order of magnitude larger. To prevent newly formed giant planets from growing larger than , protoplanetary disks must therefore be significantly less viscous or of lower mass than typically assumed during the runaway gas accretion stage of giant planet formation. Either effect would act to slow the Type I/II migration of planetary embryos/giant planets and promote their survival.

	abstract = {We compile observations of early-type binaries identified via spectroscopy, eclipses, long-baseline interferometry, adaptive optics, common proper motion, etc. Each observational technique is sensitive to companions across a narrow parameter space of orbital periods P and mass ratios q = /M 1. After combining the samples from the various surveys and correcting for their respective selection effects, we find that the properties of companions to O-type and B-type main-sequence (MS) stars differ among three regimes. First, at short orbital periods P ≲ 20 days (separations a ≲ 0.4 au), the binaries have small eccentricities e ≲ 0.4, favor modest mass ratios , and exhibit a small excess of twins q {\textgreater} 0.95. Second, the companion frequency peaks at intermediate periods log P (days) ≈ 3.5 (a ≈ 10 au), where the binaries have mass ratios weighted toward small values q ≈ 0.2–0.3 and follow a Maxwellian “thermal” eccentricity distribution. Finally, companions with long orbital periods log P (days) ≈ 5.5–7.5 (a ≈ 200–5000 au) are outer tertiary components in hierarchical triples and have a mass ratio distribution across q ≈ 0.1–1.0 that is nearly consistent with random pairings drawn from the initial mass function. We discuss these companion distributions and properties in the context of binary-star formation and evolution. We also reanalyze the binary statistics of solar-type MS primaries, taking into account that 30\% ± 10\% of single-lined spectroscopic binaries likely contain white dwarf companions instead of low-mass stellar secondaries. The mean frequency of stellar companions with q {\textgreater} 0.1 and log P (days) {\textless} 8.0 per primary increases from 0.50 ± 0.04 for solar-type MS primaries to 2.1 ± 0.3 for O-type MS primaries.

These stars, namely, HD 34445, HD 126614, HD 13931, and Gl 179, all show evidence for a single planet in Keplerian motion. We also present Doppler measurements from the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) for two of the stars, HD 34445 and Gl 179, that confirm the Keck detections and significantly refine the orbital parameters. These planets add to the statistical properties of giant planets orbiting near or beyond the ice line, and merit follow-up by astrometry, imaging, and space-borne spectroscopy. Their orbital parameters span wide ranges of planetary minimum mass (M sin i = 0.38-1.9 M Jup), orbital period (P = 2.87-11.5 yr), semimajor axis (a = 2.1-5.2 AU), and eccentricity (e = 0.02-0.41).

metal-rich star HD 126614 (which we now refer to as HD 126614 A). The planet, HD 126614 Ab, has minimum mass M sin i = 0.38 M Jup and orbits the stellar primary with period P = 3.41 yr and orbital separation a = 2.3 AU.

The stellar primary in this new system, HD 126614 A, has the highest measured metallicity ([Fe/H] = +0.56) of any known planet-bearing star. HD 13931 b (P = 11.5 yr, M sin i = 1.88 M

The high metallicity of Gl 179 is consistent with the planet-metallicity correlation among M dwarfs, as documented recently by Johnson \& Apps.

	abstract = {It is suggested that the distribution of orbital eccentricities for extrasolar planets is well described by the Beta distribution. Several properties of the Beta distribution make it a powerful tool for this purpose. For example, the Beta distribution can reproduce a diverse range of probability density functions (PDFs) using just two shape parameters (a and b). We argue that this makes it ideal for serving as a parametric model in Bayesian comparative population analysis. The Beta distribution is also uniquely defined over the interval zero to unity, meaning that it can serve as a proper prior for eccentricity when analysing the observations of bound extrasolar planets. Using nested sampling, we find that the distribution of eccentricities for 396 exoplanets detected through radial velocity with high signal-to-noise is well described by a Beta distribution with parameters a = 0.867+0.044−0.044−0.044+0.044\{{\textasciicircum}\{+ 0.044\}\_\{- 0.044\}\} and b = 3.03+0.17−0.16−0.16+0.17\{{\textasciicircum}\{+ 0.17\}\_\{- 0.16\}\}. The Beta distribution is shown to be 3.7 times more likely to represent the underlying distribution of exoplanet eccentricities than the next best model: a Rayleigh + exponential distribution. The same data are also used in an example population comparison utilizing the Beta distribution, where we find that the short- and long-period planets are described by distinct Beta distributions at a confidence of 11.6σ and display a signature consistent with the effects of tidal circularization.},

	abstract = {Doppler-based planet surveys have discovered numerous giant planets but 
are incomplete beyond several AU. At larger star-planet separations,
direct planet detection through high-contrast imaging has proven
successful, but this technique is sensitive only to young planets and
characterization relies upon theoretical evolution models. Here we
demonstrate that radial velocity measurements and high-contrast imaging
can be combined to overcome these issues. The presence of widely
separated companions can be deduced by identifying an acceleration
(long-term trend) in the radial velocity of a star. By obtaining high
spatial resolution follow-up imaging observations, we rule out scenarios
in which such accelerations are caused by stellar binary companions with
high statistical confidence. We report results from an analysis of
Doppler measurements of a sample of 111 M-dwarf stars with a median of
29 radial velocity observations over a median time baseline of 11.8 yr.
By targeting stars that exhibit a radial velocity acceleration ("trend")
with adaptive optics imaging, we determine that 6.5\% ± 3.0\% of
M-dwarf stars host one or more massive companions with 1 {\textless}
m/MJ {\textless} 13 and 0 {\textless} a {\textless} 20 AU. These results are lower
than analyses of the planet occurrence rate around higher-mass stars. We
find the giant planet occurrence rate is described by a double power law
in stellar mass M and metallicity F ≡ [Fe/H] such that f(M,F) =
0.039{\textasciicircum}\{+0.056\}\_\{-0.028\} M{\textasciicircum}\{0.8{\textasciicircum}\{+1.1\}\_\{-0.9\}\} 10{\textasciicircum}\{(3.8 +/- 1.2)F\}. Our
results are consistent with gravitational microlensing measurements of
the planet occurrence rate; this study represents the first
model-independent comparison with microlensing observations.},

companions to 123 known exoplanet systems with one or two planets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Our survey is sensitive to Jupiter-mass planets out to 20 au for a majority of stars in our sample, and we report the discovery of eight new long-period planets, in addition to 20 systems with statistically significant RV trends that indicate the presence of an outer companion beyond 5 au. We combine our RV observations with AO imaging to determine the range of allowed masses and orbital separations for these companions, and account for variations in our sensitivity to companions among stars in our sample. We estimate the total occurrence rate of companions in our sample to be 52 ± 5\% over the range 1-20 MJup and 5-20 au. Our data
also suggest a declining frequency for gas giant planets in these systems beyond 3-10 au, in contrast to earlier studies that found a rising frequency for giant planets in the range 0.01-3 au. This suggests either that the frequency of gas giant planets peaks between 3 and 10 au, or that outer companions in these systems have a different semi-major axis distribution than the overall population of gas giant planets. Our results also suggest that hot gas giants may be more likely to have an outer companion than cold gas giants. We find that planets with an outer companion have higher average eccentricities than their single counterparts, suggesting that dynamical interactions between planets may play an important role in these systems.},

The light-time effect is also not favoured due to the non-detection of changes in the systemic velocity. Orbital decay and apsidal precession are plausible but unproven.

	abstract = {The transits of a distant star by a planet on a Keplerian orbit occur at time intervals exactly equal to the orbital period. If a second planet orbits the same star, the orbits are not Keplerian and the transits are no longer exactly periodic. We compute the magnitude of the variation in the timing of the transits, δt. We investigate analytically several limiting cases: (i) interior perturbing planets with much smaller periods; (ii) exterior perturbing planets on eccentric orbits with much larger periods; (iii) both planets on circular orbits with arbitrary period ratio but not in resonance; (iv) planets on initially circular orbits locked in resonance. Using subscripts `out' and `in' for the exterior and interior planets, μ for planet-to-star mass ratio and the standard notation for orbital elements, our findings in these cases are as follows. (i) Planet-planet perturbations are negligible. The main effect is the wobble of the star due to the inner planet, and therefore δt{\textasciitilde}μ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}in{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}(a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}in{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}out{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater})P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}out{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. (ii) The exterior planet changes the period of the interior planet by μ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}out{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}(a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}in{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}out{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}){\textless}SUP{\textgreater}3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}in{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. As the distance of the exterior planet changes due to its eccentricity, the inner planet's period changes. Deviations in its transit timing accumulate over the period of the outer planet, and therefore δt{\textasciitilde}μ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}out{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}e{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}out{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}(a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}in{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}out{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}){\textless}SUP{\textgreater}3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}out{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. (iii) Halfway between resonances the perturbations are small, of the order of μ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}out{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}a{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}in{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/(a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}in{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}-a{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}out{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}){\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}in{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} for the inner planet (switch `out' and `in' for the outer planet). This increases as one gets closer to a resonance. (iv) This is perhaps the most interesting case because some systems are known to be in resonances and the perturbations are the largest. As long as the perturber is more massive than the transiting planet, the timing variations would be of the order of the period regardless of the perturber mass. For lighter perturbers, we show that the timing variations are smaller than the period by the perturber-to-transiting-planet mass ratio. An earth-mass planet in 2:1 resonance with a three-dimensional period transiting planet (e.g. HD 209458b) would cause timing variations of the order of 3 min, which would be accumulated over a year. This signal of a terrestrial planet is easily detectable with current ground-based measurements. For the case in which both planets are on eccentric orbits, we compute numerically the transit timing variations for several known multiplanet systems, assuming they are edge-on. Transit timing measurements may be used to constrain the masses, radii and orbital elements of planetary systems, and, when combined with radial velocity measurements, provide a new means of measuring the mass and radius of the host star.},

	abstract = {Transit timing variations (TTVs) of exoplanets are normally interpreted 
as the consequence of gravitational interaction with additional bodies
in the system. However, TTVs can also be caused by deformations of the
system transits by starspots, which might thus pose a serious
complication in their interpretation. We therefore simulate transit
light curves deformed by spot-crossing events for different properties
of the stellar surface and the planet, such as starspot position, limb
darkening, planetary period, and impact parameter. Mid-transit times
determined from these simulations can be significantly shifted with
respect to the input values; these shifts cannot be larger than 1\% of
the transit duration and depend very strongly on the longitudinal
position of the spot during the transit and the transit duration.
Consequently, TTVs with amplitudes larger than the above limit are very
unlikely to be caused by starspots. We also investigate whether TTVs
from sequences of consecutive transits with spot-crossing anomalies can
be misinterpreted as the result of an additional body in the system. We
use the Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram to search for periods in
TTVs and conclude that low-amplitude TTVs with statistically significant
periods around active stars are the most problematic cases. In those
cases where the photometric precision is high enough to inspect the
transit shapes for deformations it should be possible to identify TTVs
caused by starspots; however, especially for cases with low
signal-to-noise in transit (TSNR ≲ 15) light curves it becomes
quite difficult to reliably decide whether these periods come from
starspots, physical companions in the system, or if they are random
noise artifacts.},

    The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based
    Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS
    adiabatic pulsation code with MESA star. This also motivates a numerical
    recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when
    many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the
    way in which MESA star calculates semi-convective and thermohaline
    mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M ⊙ stars through
    the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival
    on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular
    momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of
    rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We
    introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows
    the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This

The precession of the orbit results in a systematic variation in both the duration of individual transit events and the observed period between successive transits, P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}obs{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. The periastron of the ellipse slowly precesses due to general relativity and possibly the presence of other planets in the system. This secular precession can be detected through the long-term change in P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}obs{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (transit timing variations, TTV) or in T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}D{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (transit duration variations, TDV). We estimate the corresponding precession measurement precision for repeated future observations of the known eccentric transiting exoplanetary systems (XO-3b, HD 147506b, GJ 436b and HD 17156b) using existing or planned space-borne instruments. The TDV measurement improves the precession detection sensitivity by orders of magnitude over the TTV measurement. We find that TDV measurements over a approximately 4yr period can typically detect the precession rate to a precision well exceeding the level predicted by general relativity.},

	abstract = {We describe the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS), which is a ground-based project searching for transiting exoplanets orbiting bright stars. NGTS builds on the legacy of previous surveys, most notably WASP, and is designed to achieve higher photometric precision and hence find smaller planets than have previously been detected from the ground. It also operates in red light, maximizing sensitivity to late K and early M dwarf stars. The survey specifications call for photometric precision of 0.1 per cent in red light over an instantaneous field of view of 100 deg{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, enabling the detection of Neptune-sized exoplanets around Sun-like stars and super-Earths around M dwarfs. The survey is carried out with a purpose-built facility at Cerro Paranal, Chile, which is the premier site of the European Southern Observatory (ESO). An array of twelve 20 cm f/2.8 telescopes fitted with back-illuminated deep-depletion CCD cameras is used to survey fields intensively at intermediate Galactic latitudes. The instrument is also ideally suited to ground-based photometric follow-up of exoplanet candidates from space telescopes such as TESS, Gaia and PLATO. We present observations that combine precise autoguiding and the superb observing conditions at Paranal to provide routine photometric precision of 0.1 per cent in 1 h for stars with I-band magnitudes brighter than 13. We describe the instrument and data analysis methods as well as the status of the survey, which achieved first light in 2015 and began full-survey operations in 2016. NGTS data will be made publicly available through the ESO archive.},

	abstract = {PLATO 2.0 has recently been selected for ESA's M3 launch opportunity (2022/24). Providing accurate key planet parameters (radius, mass, density and age) in statistical numbers, it addresses fundamental questions such as: How do planetary systems form and evolve? Are there other systems with planets like ours, including potentially habitable planets? The PLATO 2.0 instrument consists of 34 small aperture telescopes (32 with 25 s readout cadence and 2 with 2.5 s candence) providing a wide field-of-view (2232 deg {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) and a large photometric magnitude range (4-16 mag). It focusses on bright (4-11 mag) stars in wide fields to detect and characterize planets down to Earth-size by photometric transits, whose masses can then be determined by ground-based radial-velocity follow-up measurements. Asteroseismology will be performed for these bright stars to obtain highly accurate stellar parameters, including masses and ages. The combination of bright targets and asteroseismology results in high accuracy for the bulk planet parameters: 2 \%, 4-10 \% and 10 \% for planet radii, masses and ages, respectively. The planned baseline observing strategy includes two long pointings (2-3 years) to detect and bulk characterize planets reaching into the habitable zone (HZ) of solar-like stars and an additional step-and-stare phase to cover in total about 50 \% of the sky. PLATO 2.0 will observe up to 1,000,000 stars and detect and characterize hundreds of small planets, and thousands of planets in the Neptune to gas giant regime out to the HZ. It will therefore provide the first large-scale catalogue of bulk characterized planets with accurate radii, masses, mean densities and ages. This catalogue will include terrestrial planets at intermediate orbital distances, where surface temperatures are moderate. Coverage of this parameter range with statistical numbers of bulk characterized planets is unique to PLATO 2.0. The PLATO 2.0 catalogue allows us to e.g.: - complete our knowledge of planet diversity for low-mass objects, - correlate the planet mean density-orbital distance distribution with predictions from planet formation theories,- constrain the influence of planet migration and scattering on the architecture of multiple systems, and - specify how planet and system parameters change with host star characteristics, such as type, metallicity and age. The catalogue will allow us to study planets and planetary systems at different evolutionary phases. It will further provide a census for small, low-mass planets. This will serve to identify objects which retained their primordial hydrogen atmosphere and in general the typical characteristics of planets in such low-mass, low-density range. Planets detected by PLATO 2.0 will orbit bright stars and many of them will be targets for future atmosphere spectroscopy exploring their atmosphere. Furthermore, the mission has the potential to detect exomoons, planetary rings, binary and Trojan planets. The planetary science possible with PLATO 2.0 is complemented by its impact on stellar and galactic science via asteroseismology as well as light curves of all kinds of variable stars, together with observations of stellar clusters of different ages. This will allow us to improve stellar models and study stellar activity. A large number of well-known ages from red giant stars will probe the structure and evolution of our Galaxy. Asteroseismic ages of bright stars for different phases of stellar evolution allow calibrating stellar age-rotation relationships. Together with the results of ESA's Gaia mission, the results of PLATO 2.0 will provide a huge legacy to planetary, stellar and galactic science.},

Radial velocity observations quickly verified that the photometric signals were indeed produced by two transiting hot Jupiters. Our observations also show the presence of additional Doppler signals. In addition to short-period hot Jupiters, we find that the WASP-53 and WASP-81 systems also host brown dwarfs, on fairly eccentric orbits with semimajor axes of a few astronomical units. WASP-53c is over 16 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}sin I{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}c{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and WASP-81c is 57 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}sin I{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}c{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. The presence of these tight, massive companions restricts theories of how the inner planets were assembled. We propose two alternative interpretations: the formation of the hot Jupiters within the snow line or the late dynamical arrival of the brown dwarfs after disc dispersal. We also attempted to measure the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for both hot Jupiters. In the case of WASP-81b, we fail to detect a signal. For WASP-53b, we find that the planet is aligned with respect to the stellar spin axis. In addition we explore the prospect of transit-timing variations, and of using Gaia's astrometry to measure the true masses of both brown dwarfs and also their relative inclination with respect to the inner transiting hot Jupiters.},

HATS-16 is slightly active and shows a periodic photometric modulation, implying a rotational period of 12 days, which is unexpectedly short given its isochronal age. This fast rotation might be the result of the tidal interaction between the star and its planet.

In this paper, we apply the method to two transiting hot Jupiter systems monitored with the Kepler spacecraft, Kepler-13A and HAT-P-7.

In our solution, the discrepancy between the above λ and that previously reported by Barnes et al. is solved by fitting both of the parameters in the quadratic limb-darkening law. We also report the temporal variation in the orbital inclination of Kepler-13Ab, d{\textbar}cos {\textbackslash}\{\{i\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}orb{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}{\textbar}/dt=(-7.0+/- 0.4)× \{\{10\}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-6{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}\} day\{\{s\}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}\}, providing further evidence for the spin-orbit precession in this system.

The plane of the planet's orbit is rapidly precessing, and its inclination only becomes sufficiently aligned with the primary star in the latter portion of the Kepler data.

The precession period is ∼103 years, and during that cycle, transits are visible only ∼8.9\% of the time. This has the important implication that for every system like Kepler-453 that we detect, there are ∼11.5 circumbinary systems that exist but are not currently exhibiting transits. The planet's mass is too small to noticeably perturb the binary, and consequently its mass is not measurable with these data; however, our photodynamical model places a 1 σ upper limit of \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/26/apj517318ieqn3.gif] \$16{\textbackslash};M\_øplus \$ .

We analysed Kepler short cadence data up to Quarter 14, with a total time-span of 928 d, to reveal changes in transit duration, depth, asymmetry and identify the possible signals of stellar rotation and low-level activity. We investigated long-term variations of transit light curves testing for duration, peak depth and asymmetry. We also performed cluster analysis on Kepler quarters. We computed the autocorrelation function of the out-of-transit light variations. Transit duration, peak depth and asymmetry evolve slowly, due to the slowly drifting transit path through the stellar disc. The detected transit shapes will map the stellar surface on the time-scale of decades. We found a very significant clustering pattern with 3-orbit period. Its source is very probably the rotating stellar surface, in the 5:3 spin-orbit resonance reported in a previous study. The autocorrelation function of the out-of-transit light variations, filtered to 25.4 h and harmonics, shows slow variations and a peak around 300-360 d period, which could be related to the activity cycle of the host star.},

	abstract = {KOI-13 is the first known transiting system exhibiting light-curve distortions due to gravity darkening of the rapidly rotating host star. In this Letter, we analyse publicly available Kepler Q2-Q3 short-cadence observations, revealing a continuous light variation with a period of P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}rot{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}= 25.43 ± 0.05 h and a half-amplitude of 21 ppm, which is linked to stellar rotation. This period is in exact 5:3 resonance with the orbit of KOI-13.01, which is the first detection of a spin-orbit resonance in a host of a substellar companion. The stellar rotation leads to stellar oblateness, which is expected to cause secular variations in the orbital elements. We indeed detect the gradual increment of the transit duration with a rate of (1.14 ± 0.30) × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-6{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} d cycle{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. The confidence of this trend is 3.85σ, and the two-sided false alarm probability is 0.012 per cent. We suggest that the reason for this variation is the expected change of the impact parameter, with a rate of d b/d t=-0.016 ± 0.004 yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. Assuming b≈ 0.25, KOI-13.01 may become a non-transiting object in 75-100 years. The observed rate is compatible with the expected secular perturbations due to the stellar oblateness yielded by the fast rotation.},

	abstract = {PTFO 8-8695b represents the first transiting exoplanet candidate orbiting a pre-main-sequence star (van Eyken et al. 2012, ApJ, 755, 42). We find that the unusual lightcurve shapes of PTFO 8-8695 can be explained by transits of a planet across an oblate, gravity-darkened stellar disk. We develop a theoretical framework for understanding precession of a planetary orbit's ascending node for the case when the stellar rotational angular momentum and the planetary orbital angular momentum are comparable in magnitude. We then implement those ideas to simultaneously and self-consistently fit two separate lightcurves observed in 2009 December and 2010 December. Our two self-consistent fits yield M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 3.0 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 3.6 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} for assumed stellar masses of M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.34 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.44 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} respectively. The two fits have precession periods of 293 days and 581 days. These mass determinations (consistent with previous upper limits) along with the strength of the gravity-darkened precessing model together validate PTFO 8-8695b as just the second hot Jupiter known to orbit an M-dwarf. Our fits show a high degree of spin-orbit misalignment in the PTFO 8-8695 system: 69° ± 2° or 73.°1 ± 0.°5, in the two cases. The large misalignment is consistent with the hypothesis that planets become hot Jupiters with random orbital plane alignments early in a system's lifetime. We predict that as a result of the highly misaligned, precessing system, the transits should disappear for months at a time over the course of the system's precession period. The precessing, gravity-darkened model also predicts other observable effects: changing orbit inclination that could be detected by radial velocity observations, changing stellar inclination that would manifest as varying vsin i, changing projected spin-orbit alignment that could be seen by the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, changing transit shapes over the course of the precession, and differing lightcurves as a function of wavelength. Our measured planet radii of 1.64 R {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and 1.68 R {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} in each case are consistent with a young, hydrogen-dominated planet that results from a "hot-start" formation mechanism.},

This is likely to induce a secular oscillation in the eccentricity of the inner WJ that brings its periastron close enough to the host star for tidal star-planet interactions to be significant. In the Kepler-448 system, the mutual inclination is weakly constrained, and such an eccentricity oscillation is possible for a fraction of the solutions. Thus these WJs may be undergoing tidal migration to become hot Jupiters (HJs), although the migration via this process from beyond the snow line is disfavored by the close-in and massive nature of the companions. This may indicate that WJs can be formed in situ and could even evolve into HJs via high-eccentricity migration inside the snow line.},

The orbital plane of the EB is slightly inclined to the line of sight (i {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}EB{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 87.°33 ± 0.°06), while that of the planet is inclined by {\textasciitilde}2.°5 to the binary plane at the reference epoch. Orbital precession with a period of {\textasciitilde}11 yr causes the inclination of the latter to the sky plane to continuously change. As a result, the planet often fails to transit the primary star at inferior conjunction, causing stretches of hundreds of days with no transits (corresponding to multiple planetary orbital periods). We predict that the next transit will not occur until 2020. The orbital configuration of the system places the planet slightly closer to its host stars than the inner edge of the extended habitable zone. Additionally, the orbital configuration of the system is such that the CBP may experience Cassini State dynamics under the influence of the EB, in which the planet's obliquity precesses with a rate comparable to its orbital precession. Depending on the angular precession frequency of the CBP, it could potentially undergo obliquity fluctuations of dozens of degrees (and complex seasonal cycles) on precession timescales.},

We find that the mass loss rate drops by a factor of ≈1.5-2, while the angular momentum loss rate drops by a factor of ≈4 as the distance decreases past the Alfvén surface. This reduction in angular momentum loss is due to the interaction between the stellar and planetary Alfvén surfaces, which modifies the global structure of the stellar corona and stellar wind on the hemisphere facing the planet, as well as on the opposite hemisphere. The simulation also shows that the magnitude of change in angular momentum loss rate depends mostly on the strength of the planetary magnetic field and not on its polarity. The interaction, however, begins at greater separation if the overall field topology of the star and the planet are anti-aligned. Our results are consistent with evidence for excess angular momentum in stars harboring close-in giant planets and show that the reduction in wind-driven angular momentum loss can compete with, and perhaps dominate, spin-up due to tidal interaction.},

The existence of this unique solution is very useful for current planet transit surveys for several reasons. First, there is an analytic solution that allows a quick parameter estimate, in particular of R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Second, the stellar density can be uniquely derived from the transit light curve alone. The stellar density can then be used to immediately rule out a giant star (and hence a much larger than planetary companion) and can also be used to put an upper limit on the stellar and planet radius even considering slightly evolved stars. Third, the presence of an additional fully blended star that contaminates an eclipsing system to mimic a planet transit can be largely ruled out from the transit light curve given a spectral type for the central star. Fourth, the period can be estimated from a single-transit light curve and a measured spectral type. All of these applications can be used to select the best planet transit candidates for mass determination by radial velocity follow-up. To use these applications in practice, the photometric precision and time sampling of the light curve must be high (better than 0.005 mag precision and 5 minute time sampling for a two-transit light curve).},

We also determine each star’s mass using our newly determined radius and the stellar density, a virtually model independent quantity itself from previously published transit analyses. These stellar radii and masses are in turn used to redetermine the transiting-planet radii and masses, again using only direct observables. The median uncertainties on the stellar radii and masses are 8\% and 30\%, respectively, and the resulting uncertainties on the planet radii and masses are 9\% and 22\%, respectively. These accuracies are generally larger than previously published model-dependent precisions of 5\% and 6\% on the planet radii and masses, respectively, but the newly determined values are purely empirical. We additionally report radii for 242 stars hosting radial-velocity (non-transiting) planets, with a median achieved accuracy of ≈2\%.

The evidence is based on 14 new measurements of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect (for the systems HAT-P-6, HAT-P-7, HAT-P-16, HAT-P-24, HAT-P-32, HAT-P-34, WASP-12, WASP-16, WASP-18, WASP-19, WASP-26, WASP-31, Gl 436, and Kepler-8), as well as a critical review of previous observations. The low-obliquity (well-aligned) systems are those for which the expected tidal timescale is short, and likewise the high-obliquity (misaligned and retrograde) systems are those for which the expected timescale is long. At face value, this finding indicates that the origin of hot Jupiters involves dynamical interactions like planet-planet interactions or the Kozai effect that tilt their orbits rather than inspiraling due to interaction with a protoplanetary disk. We discuss the status of this hypothesis and the observations that are needed for a more definitive conclusion.},

	abstract = {Recent analyses have revealed a mystery. The orbital period of the highly inflated hot Jupiter, WASP-12b, is decreasing rapidly. The rate of inspiral, however, is too fast to be explained by either eccentricity tides or equilibrium stellar tides. While dynamical stellar tides are possible, they require a subgiant structure for the star, whereas stellar models point toward a main sequence host. Here, we show that these hitherto irreconcilable observations might be explained by planetary obliquity tides if planet b's spin vector is trapped in a high-obliquity state maintained by a secular spin-orbit resonance with an unseen exterior perturbing planet. We derive constraints on the obliquity (\${\textbackslash}epsilon{\textbackslash}gtrsim50{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$), reduced tidal quality factor (\$Q{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}prime\}{\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{6\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{7\}\$), and perturbing planet parameters (\$M\_\{2\}{\textbackslash}sim10-20M\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$, \$a\_2{\textbackslash}lesssim0.04{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm AU\}\$) required to generate the observed orbital decay. Direct N-body simulations that include tidal and spin dynamics reinforce the plausibility of the scenario. Furthermore, we show that the resonance could have been captured when planet b's obliquity was small, making the proposed sequence of events easy to explain. The hypothetical perturbing planet is within the limits of current radial velocity constraints on the system yet is also detectable. If it exists, it could provide evidence in favor of the in situ formation hypothesis for hot Jupiters.},

	abstract = {This article presents and discusses a critical compilation of accurate, fundamental determinations of stellar masses and radii. We have
identified 95 detached binary systems containing 190 stars (94 eclipsing systems, and α Centauri) that satisfy our criterion that the mass and radius of both stars be known within errors of ±3\% accuracy
or better. All of them are non-interacting systems, and so the stars should have evolved as if they were single. This sample more than doubles that of the earlier similar review by Andersen (Astron Astrophys Rev 3:91-126, 1991), extends the mass range at both ends and, for the first time, includes an extragalactic binary. In every case, we have examined the original data and recomputed the stellar parameters with a consistent set of assumptions and physical constants. To these we add interstellar reddening, effective temperature, metal abundance,
rotational velocity and apsidal motion determinations when available, and we compute a number of other physical parameters, notably luminosity and distance. These accurate physical parameters reveal the effects of stellar evolution with unprecedented clarity, and we discuss the use of the data in observational tests of stellar evolution models in some detail. Earlier findings of significant structural differences between moderately fast-rotating, mildly active stars and single stars, ascribed to the presence of strong magnetic and spot activity, are confirmed beyond doubt. We also show how the best data can be used to test prescriptions for the subtle interplay between convection, diffusion, and other non-classical effects in stellar models. The amount and quality of the data also allow us to analyse the tidal evolution of the systems in considerable depth, testing prescriptions of rotational synchronisation and orbital circularisation in greater detail than possible before. We show that the formulae for pseudo-synchronisation of stars in eccentric orbits predict the observed rotations quite well, except for very young and/or widely separated stars. Deviations do occur, however, especially for stars with convective envelopes. The superior data set finally demonstrates that apsidal motion rates as predicted from General Relativity plus tidal theory are in good
agreement with the best observational data. No reliable binary data exist, which challenge General Relativity to any significant extent. The new data also enable us to derive empirical calibrations of M and R for single (post-) main-sequence stars above \{0.6 M\_\{odot\}\}. Simple, polynomial functions of T eff, log g and [Fe/H] yield M and R within errors of 6 and 3\%, respectively. Excellent agreement is found with independent determinations for host stars of transiting extrasolar planets, and good agreement with determinations of M and R from stellar models as constrained by trigonometric parallaxes and spectroscopic values of T eff and [Fe/H]. Finally, we list a set of 23 interferometric binaries with masses known to be better than 3\%, but without fundamental radius determinations (except α Aur). We
discuss the prospects for improving these and other stellar parameters in the near future.},

tidally circularized, long after the dispersal of their natal disk. We
demonstrate that the two distinct segments of the boundary are a direct

fixes the mass coordinate of the intersection point. The period

in the underlying migration model. The detailed shape of the upper

Building upon our previous work, we study the possibility that mass loss through Roche lobe overflow (RLO) may affect the evolution of these planets, and could possibly transform a hot Jupiter into a lower-mass planet (hot Neptune or super-Earth). We focus here on systems in which the mass loss occurs slowly (“stable mass transfer” in the language of binary
star evolution) and we compute their evolution in detail with the binary evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics. We include the effects of tides, RLO, irradiation, and photo-evaporation (PE) of the planet, as well as the stellar wind and magnetic braking. Our calculations all start with a hot Jupiter close to its Roche limit, in orbit around a Sun-like star. The initial orbital decay and onset of RLO are driven by tidal dissipation in the star. We confirm that such a system can indeed evolve to produce lower-mass planets in orbits of a few days. The RLO phase eventually ends and, depending on the details of the mass transfer and on the planetary core mass, the orbital period can remain around a few days for several Gyr. The remnant planets have rocky cores and some amount of envelope material, which is slowly removed via PE at a nearly constant orbital period; these have properties resembling many of the observed super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. For these remnant planets, we also predict an anti-correlation between mass and orbital period; very low-mass planets (Mpl ≲ 5
M⊕) in ultra-short periods (Porb {\textless} 1 day)
cannot be produced through this type of evolution.},

	abstract = {Many gaseous exoplanets in short-period orbits are on the verge or are in the process of Roche-lobe overflow (RLO). Moreover, orbital stability analysis shows tides can drive many hot Jupiters to spiral inevitably toward their host stars. Thus, the coupled processes of orbital evolution and RLO likely shape the observed distribution of close-in exoplanets and may even be responsible for producing some of the short-period rocky planets. However, the exact outcome for an overflowing planet depends on its internal response to mass loss, and the accompanying orbital evolution can act to enhance or inhibit RLO. In this study, we apply the fully-featured and robust Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics suite to model RLO of short-period gaseous planets. We show that, although the detailed evolution may depend on several properties of the planetary system, it is largely determined by the core mass of the overflowing gas giant. In particular, we find that the orbital expansion that accompanies RLO often stops and reverses at a specific maximum period that depends on the core mass. We suggest that RLO may often strand the remnant of a gas giant near this orbital period, which provides an observational prediction that can corroborate the hypothesis that short-period gas giants undergo RLO. We conduct a preliminary comparison of this prediction to the observed population of small, short-period planets and find some planets in orbits that may be consistent with this picture. To the extent that we can establish some short-period planets are indeed the remnants of gas giants, that population can elucidate the properties of gas giant cores, the properties of which remain largely unconstrained.},

consistently describe the distribution of extrasolar planetary systems in terms of period, eccentricity, and mass (with a lower limit of a Saturn mass) with this simple model. Our model is consistent with the survival of short-period exoplanet systems, but not with the
circularization period of equal mass stellar binaries, suggesting that the latter systems experience a higher level of dissipation than exoplanet host stars. Our model is also not consistent with the
explanation of inflated planetary radii as resulting from tidal
dissipation. The paucity of short-period planets around evolved A stars is explained as the result of enhanced tidal inspiral resulting from the increase in stellar radius with evolution.},

The process can explain the observed cutoff in small semimajor axis values, the clustering of orbital periods near three days, and the relative youth of transiting planets. Contrary to previous considerations, a mechanism to stop the inward migration of close-in planets at their current orbits is not necessarily required. Planets nearing tidal destruction may be found with extremely small semimajor axes, possibly already stripped of any gaseous envelope. The recently discovered CoroT-7 b may be an example of such a planet and will probably be destroyed by tides within the next few Gyrs. Also, where one or more planets have already been accreted, a star may exhibit an unusual composition and/or spin rate.},

To do so, we assume that they retain a nonzero eccentricity, possibly by dint of continuing interaction with a third body. We calculate the amount of extra heating in the envelope that is then required to fit the radius of each planet, and we explore how this additional power depends on the planetary atmospheric opacity and on the mass of a heavy-element central core. There is a degeneracy between the core mass M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}core{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and the heating {\textbackslash}dot\{E\}\_heating. Therefore, in the case of tidal heating, there is for each planet a range of \{M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}core{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, e {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}/Q'{\textless}SUB{\textgreater} p {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\} that can lead to the same radius, where Q'{\textless}SUB{\textgreater} p {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is the tidal dissipation factor and e is the eccentricity. With this in mind, we also investigate the case of the non-inflated planet HAT-P-12b, which can admit solutions combining a heavy-element core and tidal heating. A substantial improvement of the measured eccentricities of such planetary systems could simplify this degeneracy by linking the two unknown parameters \{M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}core{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, Q'{\textless}SUB{\textgreater} p {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}.

The planet is only 1.5 times the separation from its host star at which it would be destroyed by Roche lobe overflow, and has a predicted remaining lifetime of just ̃40 Myr, assuming a tidal dissipation quality factor of Q\_\{*\vphantom{\{}\}{\textasciicircum}'\}=10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}6{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. Q\_\{*\vphantom{\{}\}{\textasciicircum}'\} is a key factor in determining how frictional processes within a host star affect the orbital evolution of its companion giant planets, but it is currently poorly constrained by observations. We calculate that the orbital decay of WTS-2 b would correspond to a shift in its transit arrival time of T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}shift{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ̃ 17 s after 15 yr assuming Q\_\{*\vphantom{\{}\}{\textasciicircum}'\}=10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}6{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}.

We attempted to constrain Q\_\{*\vphantom{\{}\}{\textasciicircum}'\} via a study of the entire population of known transiting hot Jupiters, but our results were inconclusive, requiring a more detailed treatment of transit survey sensitivities at long periods. We conclude that the most informative and straightforward constraints on Q\_\{*\vphantom{\{}\}{\textasciicircum}'\} will be obtained by direct observational measurements of the shift in transit arrival times in individual hot Jupiter systems. We show that this is achievable across the mass spectrum of exoplanet host stars within a decade, and will directly probe the effects of stellar interior structure on tidal dissipation.},

	abstract = {Tidal dissipation within a short-period transiting extrasolar planet perturbed by a companion object can drive orbital evolution of the system to a so-called tidal fixed point, in which the apses of the transiting planet and its perturber are aligned, and variations in orbital eccentricities vanish. Significant contribution to the apsidal precession rate is made by gravitational quadrupole fields, created by the transiting planets tidal and rotational distortions. The fixed-point orbital eccentricity of the inner planet is therefore a strong function of its interior structure. We illustrate these ideas in the specific context of the recently discovered HAT-P-13 exoplanetary system, and show that one can already glean important insights into the physical properties of the inner transiting planet. We present structural models of the planet, which indicate that its observed radius can be maintained for a one-parameter sequence of models that properly vary core mass and tidal energy dissipation in the interior. We use an octupole-order secular theory of the orbital dynamics to derive the dependence of the inner planet's eccentricity, e{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}b{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} , on its tidal Love number, k {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2b {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. We find that the currently measured eccentricity, e{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}b{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.021 ± 0.009, implies 0.116 \&lt; k {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2b {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 0.425, 0 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}core{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 120 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and 10, 000 \&lt; Q{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}b{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 300, 000. Improved measurement of the eccentricity will soon allow for far tighter limits to be placed on all of these quantities, and will provide an unprecedented probe into the interior structure of an extrasolar planet.},

If a transiting planet is on an eccentric orbit then the presence of another planet causes a secular advance of the transiting planet's pericentre over and above the effect of general relativity. Although this secular effect is impractical to detect over a small number of orbits, it causes long-term differences when future transits occur, much like the long-term decay observed in pulsars. Measuring this transit-timing delay would thus allow the detection of either one or more additional planets in the system or the first measurements of non-zero oblateness (J{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) of the central stars.},

Both of these cause a precession of the orbital plane and of the periastron of the planet, which result in a long-term variation of the duration and the period of the transits. For a transiting planet at 0.05 AU, either a quadrupole moment similar to that of the Sun or the gravitational tug from an Earth-like planet on an orbit of semimajor axis {\textasciitilde}0.2 AU and a relative inclination near the optimal 45° would cause a transit duration time derivative of {\textasciitilde}1 s yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}.},

	abstract = {Transiting exoplanetary systems are surpassingly important among the planetary systems since they provide the widest spectrum of information for both the planet and the host star. If a transiting planet is on an eccentric orbit, the duration of transits T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}D{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is sensitive to the orientation of the orbital ellipse relative to the line of sight. The precession of the orbit results in a systematic variation in both the duration of individual transit events and the observed period between successive transits, P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}obs{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. The periastron of the ellipse slowly precesses due to general relativity and possibly the presence of other planets in the system. This secular precession can be detected through the long-term change in P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}obs{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (transit timing variations, TTV) or in T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}D{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (transit duration variations, TDV). We estimate the corresponding precession measurement precision for repeated future observations of the known eccentric transiting exoplanetary systems (XO-3b, HD 147506b, GJ 436b and HD 17156b) using existing or planned space-borne instruments. The TDV measurement improves the precession detection sensitivity by orders of magnitude over the TTV measurement. We find that TDV measurements over a approximately 4yr period can typically detect the precession rate to a precision well exceeding the level predicted by general relativity.},

Depending on the ratio of the mean density of the planet ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} to that of the star ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, a planet-star merger results in three possible outcomes. If ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}≳5, then the planet directly plunges below the stellar atmosphere before being disrupted by tidal forces. The dissipation of orbital energy creates a hot wake behind the planet, producing a extreme ultraviolet (EUV)/soft X-ray transient that increases in brightness and temperature as the planet sinks below the stellar surface. The peak luminosity L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}EUV/X{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≲ 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}36{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} is achieved weeks to months prior to merger, after which the stellar surface is enshrouded by an outflow driven by the merger. The final stages of the inspiral are accompanied by an optical transient powered by the recombination of hydrogen in the outflow, which peaks at a luminosity of ̃10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}37{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}-10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}38{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} on a time-scale ̃days. If the star is instead significantly denser (ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}≲5), then the planet overflows its Roche lobe above the stellar surface. For ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}≲1 mass transfer is stable, resulting in the planet being accreted on the relatively slow time-scale set by tidal dissipation. However, for an intermediate-density range 1≲ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/ρ̄{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}≲5 mass transfer may instead be unstable, resulting in the dynamical disruption of the planet into an accretion disc around the star.

Emission from the disc itself becomes visible once the accretion rate decreases below the Eddington rate, resulting in a bolometric brightening and shift of the spectral peak to ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. Optical transients from both direct-impact merger and tidal-disruption events in some ways resemble classical novae, but can be distinguished by their higher ejecta mass and lower velocity around hundreds of km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, and by hard pre- and post-cursor emission, respectively.

WASP-45b is a 1.03-MJup planet which passes in front of the

seen in the spectra of WASP-45 suggests that the star is

the star to be photospherically and chromospherically active.

We imposed circular orbits in our analyses as the radial-velocity data
are consistent with (near-)circular orbits, as could be expected from
both empirical and tidal-theory perspectives for such short-period,
˜Jupiter-mass planets. We discuss the impact of fitting for
eccentric orbits for such planets when not supported by the data. The
derived planetary and stellar radii depend on the fitted eccentricity
and these parameters inform intense theoretical efforts concerning tidal
circularization and heating, bulk planetary composition and the observed
systematic errors in planetary and stellar radii. As such, we recommend
exercising caution in fitting the orbits of short-period,

with the NTT obtaining a precision of 0.30 mmag with a cadence of
roughly 3 min. We also obtained five new spectra of WASP-45 with the
FEROS spectrograph. We improved by a factor of 4 the measurement of the

less massive and smaller than previously reported. Both planets now have

	abstract = {The `hot Jupiters' that abound in lists of known extrasolar planets are thought to have formed far from their host stars, but migrate inwards through interactions with the proto-planetary disk from which they were born, or by an alternative mechanism such as planet-planet scattering. The hot Jupiters closest to their parent stars, at orbital distances of only {\textasciitilde}0.02 astronomical units, have strong tidal interactions, and systems such as OGLE-TR-56 have been suggested as tests of tidal dissipation theory. Here we report the discovery of planet WASP-18b with an orbital period of 0.94days and a mass of ten Jupiter masses
(10MJup), resulting in a tidal interaction an order of magnitude stronger than that of planet OGLE-TR-56b. Under the assumption that the tidal-dissipation parameter Q of the host star is of the order of 106, as measured for Solar System bodies and binary stars and as often applied to extrasolar planets, WASP-18b will be spiralling inwards on a timescale less than a thousandth that of the lifetime of its host star. Therefore either WASP-18 is in a rare, exceptionally short-lived state, or the tidal dissipation in this system (and possibly other hot-Jupiter systems) must be much weaker than in the Solar System.},

	abstract = {We present new light curves of the massive hot Jupiter system WASP-18 obtained with the Spitzer spacecraft covering the entire orbit at 3.6 and 4.5 μm. These light curves are used to measure the amplitude, shape and phase of the thermal phase effect for WASP-18 b. We find that our results for the thermal phase effect are limited to an accuracy of about 0.01 per cent by systematic noise sources of unknown origin. At this level of accuracy we find that the thermal phase effect has a peak-to-peak amplitude approximately equal to the secondary eclipse depth, has a sinusoidal shape and that the maximum brightness occurs at the same phase as mid-occultation to within about 5 ° at 3.6 μm
and to within about 10 ° at 4.5 μm. The shape and amplitude of
the thermal phase curve imply very low levels of heat redistribution within the atmosphere of the planet. We also perform a separate analysis to determine the system geometry by fitting a light curve model to the data covering the occultation and the transit. The secondary eclipse depths we measure at 3.6 and 4.5 μm are in good agreement with
previous measurements and imply a very low albedo for WASP-18 b. The parameters of the system (masses, radii, etc.) derived from our analysis are also in good agreement with those from previous studies, but with improved precision. We use new high-resolution imaging and published limits on the rate of change of the mean radial velocity to check for the presence of any faint companion stars that may affect our results. We find that there is unlikely to be any significant contribution to the flux at Spitzer wavelengths from a stellar companion to WASP-18. We find that there is no evidence for variations in the times of eclipse from a linear ephemeris greater than about 100 s over 3 years.},

Previous analysis predicted a rapid orbital decay of the planet toward its host star that should be
measurable on the timescale of a few years, if the star is as
dissipative as is inferred from the circularization of close-in
solar-type binary stars. We have compiled published transit and
secondary eclipse timing (as observed by WASP, TRAPPIST, and Spitzer) with more recent unpublished light curves (as observed by TRAPPIST and Hubble Space Telescope) with coverage spanning nine years. We find no signature of a rapid decay. We conclude that the absence of rapid orbital decay most likely derives from Q‧ being larger than was
inferred from solar-type stars and find that Q‧ ≥ 1 ×
106, at 95\% confidence; this supports previous work
suggesting that F stars, with their convective cores and thin convective envelopes, are significantly less tidally dissipative than solar-type stars, with radiative cores and large convective envelopes.},

combined analysis of the WASP photometry, high-precision followup
transit photometry and radial velocities yield a planetary mass
Mp = 0.503+0.019-0.038 MJ
and radius Rp = 1.224+0.051-0.052 R\_J,

The mass and radius for the host star are M\_ast =
0.88+0.05-0.08 M\_⊙ and R\_ast =
0.870+0.025-0.036 R\_⊙. The non-zero orbital
eccentricity e = 0.054{\textasciicircum}+0.018-0.015 that we measure suggests
that the planet underwent a massive tidal heating 1 Gyr ago that could
have contributed to its inflated radius. High-precision radial
velocities obtained during a transit allow us to measure a sky-projected
angle between the stellar spin and orbital axis β =
11+14-18 deg. In addition to similar published
measurements, this result favors a dominant migration mechanism based on
tidal interactions with a protoplanetary disk.

All four transits were modelled using PRISM and GEMC, and the physical properties of the system calculated. We find the mass and radius of the host star to be 0.836 ± 0.063 M⊙ and 0.864 ± 0.024

RJup and a density of 0.244 ± 0.014
ρJup. These values are consistent with those found in the literature. In the likely hypothesis that the two spot anomalies are caused by the same starspot or starspot complex, we measure the stars rotation period and velocity to be 23.80 ± 0.15 d and 1.78

The observations were carried out using multi-object differential spectrophotometry with the Inamori-Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph on the Baade Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We model systematic effects on the observed light curves using principal component analysis on the comparison stars and allow for the presence of short and long memory correlation structure in our Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis of the transit light curves for WASP-6. The measured transmission spectrum presents a general trend of decreasing apparent planetary size with wavelength and lacks evidence for broad spectral features of Na and K predicted by clear atmosphere models. The spectrum is consistent with that expected for scattering that is more efficient in the blue, as could be caused by hazes or condensates in the atmosphere of WASP-6b. WASP-6b therefore appears to be yet another massive exoplanet with evidence for a mostly featureless transmission spectrum, underscoring the importance that hazes and condensates can have in determining the transmission spectra of exoplanets.},

From the derived light curves we have extracted the midtransit times, transit depths and transit durations for these events. The precise midtransit times obtained help improve the orbital periods and also constrain transit-time variations of the systems. For most cases the published system parameters successfully accounted for our observed light curves, but in some instances we derive improved planetary radii and orbital periods. We complemented our 2.1 m infrared observations using CCD z‧-band and B-band photometry (plus two
Hα filter observations) obtained with the Kitt Peak Visitor Center Telescope, and with four H-band transits observed in 2007 October with the NSO’s 1.6 m McMath-Pierce Solar Telescope. The principal
highlights of our results are (1) Our ensemble of J-band planetary radii agree with optical radii, with the best-fit relation being
(Rp/R∗)J = 0.0017 +
0.979(Rp/R∗)vis. (2) We observe starspot crossings during the transit of WASP-11/HAT-P-10. (3) We detect starspot crossings by HAT-P-11b (Kepler-3b), thus confirming that the magnetic evolution of the stellar active regions can be monitored even after the Kepler mission has ended. (4) We confirm a grazing transit for HAT-P-27/WASP-40. In total, we present 57 individual transits of 32 known exoplanet systems.},

The overall main characteristic of the spectrum is an increasing radius as a function of decreasing wavelength
corresponding to a change of Δ (Rp / R*) = 0.0071 from 0.33 to 4.5 μm. The spectrum suggests an effective
extinction cross-section with a power law of index consistent with Rayleigh scattering, with temperatures of 973 ± 144 K at the
planetary terminator. We compare the transmission spectrum with
hot-Jupiter atmospheric models including condensate-free and
aerosol-dominated models incorporating Mie theory. While none of the clear-atmosphere models is found to be in good agreement with the data, we find that the complete spectrum can be described by models that include significant opacity from aerosols including Fe-poor
Mg2SiO4, MgSiO3, KCl and
Na2S dust condensates. WASP-6b is the second planet after HD 189733b which has equilibrium temperatures near ˜1200 K and shows prominent atmospheric scattering in the optical.},

Combining them with other available photometric and radial velocity (RV) data, we find that its transit timings do not match a linear ephemeris; the best-fit χ2 value is 32.2 with 9 degrees of freedom, which corresponds to a confidence level of 99.982\% or 3.7σ. This result indicates that excess variations of transit timings have been observed, either due to unknown systematic effects, or possibly due to real TTVs. The TTV amplitude is as large as 50 s, and if this is real it cannot be explained by some effect other than an additional body, or bodies. From RV data, we put an upper limit on the RV amplitude caused by a possible secondary body (planet) as 21 m s-1, which corresponds to its mass of 22-70M⊕ over the orbital period ratio of the two planets from 0.2 to 5.0. From the TTV data, using numerical simulations, we narrowed the limits down to 2M⊕ near 1:2 and 2:1 mean-motion resonances (MMRs) with WASP-5b at the 3σ level, assuming that the two planets are
co-planer. We also put an upper limit of 43M⊕

span. This result discards the presence of planets more massive than
about 5 M ⊕, 1 M ⊕, and 2 M
⊕ around the 1:2, 5:3, and 2:1 orbital resonances,
respectively. These new detection limits exceed by {\textasciitilde}5-30 times the
limits imposed by current radial velocity observations in the mean
motion resonances of this system. Our search for the variation of other
parameters, such as orbital inclination and transit depth, also yields
negative results over the total time span of the transit observations.
This result supports formation theories that predict a paucity of
planetary companions to hot Jupiters.},

extrasolar planetary system WASP-5, obtained with the Danish 1.54-m
telescope at European Southern Obseratory La Silla. In order to minimize
both random and flat-fielding errors, we defocused the telescope so its
point spread function approximated an annulus of diameter 40 pixel (16
arcsec). Data reduction was undertaken using standard aperture
photometry plus an algorithm for optimally combining the ensemble of
comparison stars. The resulting light curves have point-to-point
scatters of 0.50mmag for the first transit and 0.59mmag for the second.
We construct detailed signal-to-noise ratio calculations for defocused
photometry, and apply them to our observations. We model the light
curves with the JKTEBOP code and combine the results with tabulated
predictions from theoretical stellar evolutionary models to derive the
physical properties of the WASP-5 system. We find that the planet has a
mass of Mb = 1.637 +/- 0.075 +/- 0.033MJup, a
radius of Rb = 1.171 +/- 0.056 +/- 0.012R Jup, a
large surface gravity of gb = 29.6 +/- 2.8ms-2 and
a density of ρb = 1.02 +/- 0.14 +/-
0.01ρJup (statistical and systematic uncertainties). The
planet's high equilibrium temperature of Teq = 1732 +/- 80K
makes it a good candidate for detecting secondary eclipses.

Small Terrestrial Exoplanets (MiNDSTEp) with the Danish 1.54-m telescope

We also present simulations of the planet yield for three suggested observing strategies of the TESS extended mission. We report {\textasciitilde}\$10{\textasciicircum}4\$ planets to be discovered by the TESS primary mission, as well as an additional \${\textbackslash}sim 2000\$ planets for each year of the three extended mission scenarios we explored.

We use Monte Carlo simulations to try and anticipate the quantities and types of planets that would be detected in each of 6 plausible scenarios for a one-year Extended Mission following the two-year Primary Mission. We find that: (1) there is no sharp fall-off in the planet discovery rate in the third year; (2) the quantity of newly detected sub-Neptune radius planets does not depend strongly on the schedule of pointings; (3) an important function of an Extended Mission would be improving our ability to predict the times of future transits and occultations of TESS-detected planets.},

They are examined with respect to observational manifestations which characterize already known CA stars: Ca II H and K emission cores, photometric variability attributable to starspots, soft x-ray emission, non-thermal radio emission, ultraviolet and infrared excess, and alternating period changes. The conclusion is that they can be regarded as another class of CA stars. In most respects they are literally indistinguishable from other CA stars. Ca II H and K emission cores are observed in the lobe-filling component of six semi-detached binaries: U Cep, RT Lac, RV Lib, AR Mon, S Vel, HR 5110. Alternating period changes are shown to occur only in Algols containing a late-type (convective) star. It is proposed, therefore, that the Matese-Whitmire mechanism explains these changes. Specifically, the interval from one increase (or decrease) to the next can be equated with the star's magnetic cycle. Cycle lengths for 31 stars, derived in this way, range between 7 years and 109 years, with a median of 50 years.},

The secondary component fills its Roche lobe, and its temperature is near 5000 K (plus or minus 500 K). The observations of circumstellar matter cannot be explained by a narrow ('particle dynamics') stream from Algol B to Algol A, and probably magnetic forces play a role. The period-changes indicate that mass and angular momentum are lost from the system, and again magnetic interactions could be involved. Speculatively, the 32(y) periodicity (which is not strict) is interpreted as some kind of magnetic cycle.},

	abstract = {Of the 14 transiting extrasolar planetary systems for which radii have been measured, at least three appear to be considerably larger than theoretical estimates suggest. It has been proposed by Bodenheimer, Lin \&amp; Mardling that undetected companions acting to excite the orbital eccentricity are responsible for these oversized planets, as they find new equilibrium radii in response to being tidally heated. In the case of HD 209458, this hypothesis has been rejected by some authors because there is no sign of such a companion at the 5 ms{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} level, and because it is difficult to say conclusively that the eccentricity is non-zero. Transit timing analysis as well as a direct transit search has further constrained the existence of very short period companions, especially in resonant orbits. Whether or not a companion is responsible for the large radius of HD 209458b, almost certainly some short-period systems have companions which force their eccentricities to non-zero values. This paper is dedicated to quantifying this effect. The eccentricity of a short-period planet will only be excited as long as its (non-resonant) companion's eccentricity is non-zero. Here, we show that the latter decays on a time-scale which depends on the structure of the interior planet, a time-scale which is often shorter than the lifetime of the system. This includes Earth-mass planets in the habitable zones of some stars. We determine which configurations are capable of sustaining significant eccentricity for at least the age of the system, and show that these include systems with companion masses as low as a fraction of an Earth mass. The orbital parameters of such companions are consistent with recent calculations which show that the migration process can induce the formation of low-mass planets external to the orbits of hot Jupiters. Systems with inflated planets are therefore good targets in the search for terrestrial planets.},

Though the rest-frame `tick' rate (period P) of any given pulsar is unknown, the rest-frame rates of change of the periods are known to be very small. Therefore when they are observed to be large, one is quite certain that the rate of changes must be due to changing Doppler shifts: dot\{P\} to acceleration, ddot\{P\} to jerk, and periodic shifts to orbiting companion stars or planets. The first two give otherwise unobtainable information on the density and masses of the stellar remnants in the cores of globular clusters. The orbits of binary pulsars provide a test of the theory of the evolution of red giant stars, and in globular clusters provide the first direct evidence for the three- and four-body encounters which are believed to determine the dynamical evolution of globular clusters. The orbits of binary pulsars in our own Galaxy also show evidence for the fluctuations which the fluctuation-dissipation theorem implies should occur during the dissipative tidal circularization of orbits. And newtonian dynamical effects may soon add irrefutable confirmation to recent observations suggesting that some pulsars are surrounded by planetary systems similar to our own. There may not be life on their planets, but pulsars certainly breathe new life into the study of newtonian dynamical systems.},

transiting extrasolar planets to probe the spatial variation of their
thermal emission. This technique permits an observer to resolve the
surface of the planet without the need to spatially isolate its light
from that of the central star. We evaluate the feasibility of this
technique for the HD 209458 system by simulating observations made with
the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC). We consider two
representations of the planetary thermal emission: a simple model
parameterized by a sinusoidal dependence on longitude and latitude, and
the results of a three-dimensional dynamical simulation of the planetary
atmosphere previously published by Cooper \& Showman. We find that
observations of the secondary eclipse light curve are most sensitive to
a longitudinal asymmetry in the dayside planetary emission. To quantify
this signal, we define a new parameter, the ``uniform time offset,''
which measures the time lag between the observed secondary eclipse and
that predicted by a planet with spatially uniform emission. We compare
the predicted amplitude of this parameter for HD 20948 with the
precision with which it could be measured with IRAC. We find that IRAC
observations at 3.6μm of a single secondary eclipse should permit
sufficient precision to confirm or reject the Cooper \& Showman model
of the surface flux distribution for this planet. We quantify the
signal-to-noise ratio for this offset in the remaining IRAC bands and
find that a modest improvement in photometric precision should permit a
similarly robust detection.},

	abstract = {We observed two secondary eclipses of the exoplanet WASP-12b using the Infrared Array Camera on the Spitzer Space Telescope. The close proximity of WASP-12b to its G-type star results in extreme tidal forces capable of inducing apsidal precession with a period as short as a few decades. This precession would be measurable if the orbit had a significant eccentricity, leading to an estimate of the tidal Love number and an assessment of the degree of central concentration in the planetary interior. An initial ground-based secondary-eclipse phase reported by López-Morales et al. (0.510 ± 0.002) implied eccentricity at the 4.5σ level. The spectroscopic orbit of Hebb et al. has eccentricity 0.049 ± 0.015, a 3σ result, implying an eclipse phase of 0.509 ± 0.007. However, there is a well-documented tendency of spectroscopic data to overestimate small eccentricities. Our eclipse phases are 0.5010 ± 0.0006 (3.6 and 5.8 μm) and 0.5006 ± 0.0007 (4.5 and 8.0 μm). An unlikely orbital precession scenario invoking an alignment of the orbit during the Spitzer observations could have explained this apparent discrepancy, but the final eclipse phase of López-Morales et al. (0.510 ±{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.007{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.006{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) is consistent with a circular orbit at better than 2σ. An orbit fit to all the available transit, eclipse, and radial-velocity data indicates precession at \&lt;1σ a non-precessing solution fits better.

	abstract = {We present Ks, H, \&amp; J-band photometry of the very highly irradiated hot Jupiter WASP-12b using the Wide-field Infrared Camera on the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope. Our photometry brackets the secondary eclipse of WASP-12b in the Ks and H bands, and in J band starts in mid-eclipse and continues until well after the end of the eclipse. We detect its thermal emission in all three near-infrared bands. Our secondary eclipse depths are 0.309{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.013{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.012{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\% in Ks band (24σ), 0.176{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.016{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.021{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\% in H band (9σ), and 0.131{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.027{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.029{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\% in J band (4σ). All three secondary eclipses are best fit with a consistent phase, phi, that is compatible with a circular orbit: phi = 0.4998{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.0008{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.0007{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. The limits on the eccentricity, e, and argument of periastron, ω, of this planet from our photometry alone are thus {\textbar}ecos ω{\textbar} \&lt; 0.0040. By combining our secondary eclipse times with others published in the literature, as well as the radial-velocity and transit-timing data for this system, we show that there is no evidence that WASP-12b is precessing at a detectable rate and that its orbital eccentricity is likely zero. Our thermal-emission measurements also allow us to constrain the characteristics of the planet's atmosphere; our Ks-band eclipse depth argues strongly in favor of inefficient day to nightside redistribution of heat and a low Bond albedo for this very highly irradiated hot Jupiter. The J- and H-band brightness temperatures are slightly cooler than the Ks-band brightness temperature, and thus hint at the possibility of a modest temperature inversion deep in the atmosphere of WASP-12b; the high-pressure, deep atmospheric layers probed by our J- and H-band observations are likely more homogenized than the higher altitude layer probed by our Ks-band observations. Lastly, our best-fit Ks-band eclipse has a marginally longer duration than would otherwise be expected; this may be tentative evidence for material being tidally stripped from the planet—as was predicted for this system by Li and collaborators, and for which observational confirmation was recently arguably provided by Fossati and collaborators.

	abstract = {We report the results of an analysis of all Spitzer/MIPS 24 μm observations of HD 209458b, one of the touchstone objects in the study of irradiated giant planet atmospheres. Altogether, we analyze two and a half transits, three eclipses, and a 58 hr near-continuous observation designed to detect the planet's thermal phase curve. The results of our analysis are: (1) a mean transit depth of 1.484\% ± 0.033\%, consistent with previous measurements and showing no evidence of variability in transit depth at the 3\% level. (2) A mean eclipse depth of 0.338\% ± 0.026\%, somewhat higher than that previously reported for this system; this new value brings observations into better agreement with models. From this eclipse depth we estimate an average dayside brightness temperature of 1320 ± 80 K; the dayside flux shows no evidence of variability at the 12\% level. (3) Eclipses in the system occur 32 ± 129 s earlier than would be expected from a circular orbit, which constrains the orbital quantity ecos ω to be 0.00004 ± 0.00033. This result is fully consistent with a circular orbit and sets an upper limit of 140 m s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} (3σ) on any eccentricity-induced velocity offset during transit. The phase curve observations (including one of the transits) exhibit an anomalous trend similar to the detector ramp seen in previous Spitzer/IRAC observations; by modeling this ramp we recover the system parameters for this transit. The long-duration photometry which follows the ramp and transit exhibits a gradual {\textasciitilde}0.2\% decrease in flux over {\textasciitilde}30 hr. This effect is similar to that seen in pre-launch calibration data taken with the 24 μm array and is better fit by an instrumental model than a model invoking planetary emission. The large uncertainties associated with this poorly understood, likely instrumental effect prevent us from usefully constraining the planet's thermal phase curve. Our observations highlight the need for a thorough understanding of detector-related instrumental effects on long timescales when making the high-precision mid-infrared measurements planned for future missions such as EChO, SPICA, and the James Webb Space Telescope.},

We develop a new technique for modeling this effect and use it to determine the inclination of the planetary orbit relative to the apparent stellar equator (λ=-4.4d+/-1.4d), and the line-of-sight rotation speed of the star (vsinI{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=4.70+/-0.16 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}). The uncertainty in these quantities has been reduced by an order of magnitude relative to the pioneering measurements by Queloz and collaborators.

We use several novel techniques in our data analysis, the most important of which is a new correction for the detector "ramp" variation with a double-exponential function, which performs better and is a better physical model for this detector variation. Our main scientific findings are (1) an upper limit on the variability of the dayside planet flux of 2.7\% (68\% confidence); (2) the most precise set of transit times measured for a transiting planet, with an average accuracy of 3 s; (3) a lack of transit-timing variations, excluding the presence of second planets in this system above 20\% of the mass of Mars in low-order mean-motion resonance at 95\% confidence; (4) a confirmation of the planet's phase variation, finding the night side is 64\% as bright as the day side, as well as an upper limit on the nightside variability of 17\% (68\% confidence); (5) a better correction for stellar variability at 8 μm causing the phase function to peak 3.5 hr before secondary eclipse, confirming that the advection and radiation timescales are comparable at the 8 μm photosphere; (6) variation in the depth of transit, which possibly implies variations in the surface brightness of the portion of the star occulted by the planet, posing a fundamental limit on non-simultaneous multi-wavelength transit absorption measurements of planet atmospheres; (7) a measurement of the infrared limb darkening of the star, which is in good agreement with stellar atmosphere models; (8) an offset in the times of secondary eclipse of 69 s, which is mostly accounted for by a 31 s light-travel time delay and 33 s delay due to the shift of ingress and egress by the planet hot spot; this confirms that the phase variation is due to an offset hot spot on the planet; (9) a retraction of the claimed eccentricity of this system due to the offset of secondary eclipse, which is now just an upper limit; and (10) high-precision measurements of the parameters of this system. These results were enabled by the exquisite photometric precision of Spitzer IRAC; for repeat observations the scatter is less than 0.35 mmag over the 590 day timescale of our observations after decorrelating with detector parameters.},

	abstract = {`Hot Jupiter' extrasolar planets are expected to be tidally locked because they are close (\&lt;0.05 astronomical units, where 1AU is the average Sun-Earth distance) to their parent stars, resulting in permanent daysides and nightsides. By observing systems where the planet and star periodically eclipse each other, several groups have been able to estimate the temperatures of the daysides of these planets. A key question is whether the atmosphere is able to transport the energy incident upon the dayside to the nightside, which will determine the temperature at different points on the planet's surface. Here we report observations of HD 189733, the closest of these eclipsing planetary systems, over half an orbital period, from which we can construct a `map' of the distribution of temperatures. We detected the increase in brightness as the dayside of the planet rotated into view. We estimate a minimum brightness temperature of 973+/-33K and a maximum brightness temperature of 1,212+/-11K at a wavelength of 8μm, indicating that energy from the irradiated dayside is efficiently redistributed throughout the atmosphere, in contrast to a recent claim for another hot Jupiter. Our data indicate that the peak hemisphere-integrated brightness occurs 16+/-6° before opposition, corresponding to a hotspot shifted east of the substellar point. The secondary eclipse (when the planet moves behind the star) occurs 120+/-24s later than predicted, which may indicate a slightly eccentric orbit.},

Consequently, conventional circularization and synchronization timescales cannot be defined because the corresponding states do not represent the endpoint of the tidal evolution. Using numerical simulations of the coupled tidal equations for the spin and orbital parameters of each transiting planetary system, we confirm these predictions and show that the orbital eccentricity and the stellar obliquity do not follow the usually assumed exponential relaxation but instead decrease significantly, eventually reaching a zero value only during the final runaway merging of the planet with the star. The only characteristic evolution timescale of all rotational and orbital parameters is the lifetime of the system, which crucially depends on the magnitude of tidal dissipation within the star. These results imply that the nearly circular orbits of transiting planets and the alignment between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbit are unlikely to be due to tidal dissipation. Other dissipative mechanisms, for instance interactions with the protoplanetary disk, must be invoked to explain these properties.},

	abstract = {Recent discoveries of several transiting planets with clearly non-zero eccentricities and some large obliquities started changing the simple picture of close-in planets having circular and well-aligned orbits. The two major scenarios that form such close-in planets are planet migration in a disk and planet-planet interactions combined with tidal dissipation. The former scenario can naturally produce a circular and low-obliquity orbit, while the latter implicitly assumes an initially highly eccentric and possibly high-obliquity orbit, which are then circularized and aligned via tidal dissipation. Most of these close-in planets experience orbital decay all the way to the Roche limit as previous studies showed. We investigate the tidal evolution of transiting planets on eccentric orbits, and find that there are two characteristic evolution paths for them, depending on the relative efficiency of tidal dissipation inside the star and the planet. Our study shows that each of these paths may correspond to migration and scattering scenarios. We further point out that the current observations may be consistent with the scattering scenario, where the circularization of an initially eccentric orbit occurs before the orbital decay primarily due to tidal dissipation in the planet, while the alignment of the stellar spin and orbit normal occurs on a similar timescale to the orbital decay largely due to dissipation in the star. We also find that even when the stellar spin-orbit misalignment is observed to be small at present, some systems could have had a highly misaligned orbit in the past, if their evolution is dominated by tidal dissipation in the star. Finally, we also re-examine the recent claim by Levrard et al. that all orbital and spin parameters, including eccentricity and stellar obliquity, evolve on a similar timescale to orbital decay. This counterintuitive result turns out to have been caused by a typo in their numerical code. Solving the correct set of tidal equations, we find that the eccentricity behaves as expected, with orbits usually circularizing rapidly compared to the orbital decay rate.},

	abstract = {The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will search for planets transiting bright and nearby stars. TESS has been selected by NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its 2-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical charge-coupled device cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with I{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}C{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}≈4-13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from 1 month to 1 year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every 4 months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets. The TESS legacy will be a catalog of the nearest and brightest stars hosting transiting planets, which will endure as highly favorable targets for detailed investigations.},

	abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the
	scientific community focusses on data processing for which the
	international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and
	subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built
	spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page.

	abstract = {Context. We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system. Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey.
	Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data
	products. Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the GBP (330-680 nm) and
	GRP (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. Conclusions: Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

	abstract = {In anticipation of improved observational data for Jupiter’s gravitational field, from the Juno spacecraft, we predict the static tidal response for a variety of Jupiter interior models based on ab initio computer simulations of hydrogen-helium mixtures. We calculate hydrostatic-equilibrium gravity terms, using the non-perturbative concentric Maclaurin Spheroid method that eliminates lengthy expansions used in the theory of figures. Our method captures terms arising from the coupled tidal and rotational perturbations, which we find to be important for a rapidly rotating planet like Jupiter. Our predicted static tidal Love number, \{k\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=0.5900, is ̃10\% larger than previous estimates. The value is, as expected, highly correlated with the zonal harmonic coefficient J {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and is thus nearly constant when plausible changes are made to the interior structure while holding J {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} fixed at the observed value. We note that the predicted static k {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} might change, due to Jupiter’s dynamical response to the Galilean moons, and find reasons to argue that the change may be detectable—although we do not present here a theory of dynamical tides for highly oblate Jovian planets. An accurate model of Jupiter’s tidal response will be essential for interpreting Juno observations and identifying tidal signals from effects of other interior dynamics of Jupiter’s gravitational field.},

	abstract = {We present Spitzer Space Telescope infrared photometric time series of the transiting extrasolar planet system TrES-1. The data span a predicted time of secondary eclipse, corresponding to the passage of the planet behind the star. In both bands of our observations, we detect a flux decrement with a timing, amplitude, and duration as predicted by published parameters of the system. This signal represents the first direct detection of (i.e., the observation of photons emitted by) a planet orbiting another star. The observed eclipse depths (in units of relative flux) are 0.00066+/-0.00013 at 4.5 μm and 0.00225+/-0.00036 at 8.0 μm. These estimates provide the first observational constraints on models of the thermal emission of hot Jupiters. Assuming that the planet emits as a blackbody, we estimate an effective temperature of T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=1060+/-50 K. Under the additional assumptions that the planet is in thermal equilibrium with the radiation from the star and emits isotropically, we find a Bond albedo of A=0.31+/-0.14. This would imply that the planet absorbs the majority of stellar radiation incident upon it, a conclusion of significant impact to atmospheric models of these objects. We also compare our data to a previously published model of the planetary thermal emission, which predicts prominent spectral features in our observational bands due to water and carbon monoxide. This model adequately reproduces the observed planet-to-star flux ratio at 8.0 μm however, it significantly overpredicts the ratio at 4.5 μm. We also present an estimate of the timing of the secondary eclipse, which we use to place a strong constraint on the expression ecosω, where e is the orbital eccentricity and ω is the longitude of periastron. The resulting upper limit on e is sufficiently small that we conclude that tidal dissipation is unlikely to provide a significant source of energy interior to the planet.},

the exoplanet system WASP-29 during primary transit as a test case for
differential spectrophotometry. We use the multi-object spectrograph to
observe the target star and a comparison star simultaneously to produce
multiple light curves at varying wavelengths. The `white' light curve
and 15 `spectral' light curves are analysed to refine the system
parameters and produce a transmission spectrum from ˜515 to 720
nm. All light curves exhibit time-correlated noise, which we model using
a variety of techniques. These include a simple noise rescaling, a
Gaussian process model and a wavelet-based method. These methods all
produce consistent results, although with different uncertainties. The
precision of the transmission spectrum is improved by subtracting a
common signal from all the spectral light curves, reaching a typical
precision of ˜1 × 10-4 in transit depth. The
transmission spectrum is free of spectral features, and given the
non-detection of a pressure broadened Na feature, we can rule out the
presence of a Na-rich atmosphere free of clouds or hazes, although we
cannot rule out a narrow Na core. This indicates that Na is not present
in the atmosphere, and/or that clouds/hazes play a significant role in
the atmosphere and mask the broad wings of the Na feature, although the
former is a more likely explanation given WASP-29b's equilibrium
temperature of ˜970 K, at which Na can form various compounds. We
also briefly discuss the use of Gaussian process and wavelet methods to
account for time-correlated noise in transit light curves.},

	abstract = {Accurately understanding the interior structure of extra-solar planets is critical for inferring their formation and evolution. The internal density distribution of a planet has a direct effect on the star-planet orbit through the gravitational quadrupole field created by the rotational and tidal bulges. These quadrupoles induce apsidal precession that is proportional to the planetary Love number (\$k\_\{2p\}\$, twice the apsidal motion constant), a bulk physical characteristic of the planet that depends on the internal density distribution, including the presence or absence of a massive solid core. We find that the quadrupole of the planetary tidal bulge is the dominant source of apsidal precession for very hot Jupiters (\$a {\textbackslash}lesssim 0.025\$ AU), exceeding the effects of general relativity and the stellar quadrupole by more than an order of magnitude. For the shortest-period planets, the planetary interior induces precession of a few degrees per year. By investigating the full photometric signal of apsidal precession, we find that changes in transit shapes are much more important than transit timing variations. With its long baseline of ultra-precise photometry, the space-based {\textbackslash}emph\{Kepler\} mission can realistically detect apsidal precession with the accuracy necessary to infer the presence or absence of a massive core in very hot Jupiters with orbital eccentricities as low as \$e {\textbackslash}simeq 0.003\$. The signal due to \$k\_\{2p\}\$ creates unique transit light curve variations that are generally not degenerate with other parameters or phenomena. We discuss the plausibility of measuring \$k\_\{2p\}\$ in an effort to directly constrain the interior properties of extra-solar planets.},

Linearly resonant g-modes (the dynamical tide) are driven to such large amplitudes in the stellar core that they excite a sea of other g-modes through weakly nonlinear interactions. By solving the dynamics of large networks of nonlinearly coupled modes, we show that the nonlinear dissipation rate of the dynamical tide is several orders of magnitude larger than the linear dissipation rate. We find stellar tidal quality factors \{Q\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}'{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} ≃ 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}-10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}6{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for systems with planet mass \{M\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}≳ 0.5\{M\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}\{\{J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}\} and orbital period P≲ 2 \{days\}, which implies that such systems decay on timescales that are small compared to the main-sequence lifetime of their solar-type hosts. According to our results, there are ≃ 10 currently known exoplanetary systems, including WASP-19b and HAT-P-36-b, with orbital decay timescales shorter than a Gyr. Rapid, tidally induced orbital decay may explain the observed paucity of planets with \{M\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}≳ \{M\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}\{\{J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}\} and P\&lt;2 \{days\} around solar-type hosts and could generate detectable transit-timing variations in the near future.},

Tidal interaction can modify the dynamics of the system through orbital alignment, circularization, synchronization and orbital decay by exchange of angular moment. Evidence for tidal circularization in close-in giant planet is well known. Here, we review the evidence for excess rotation of the parent stars due to the pull of tidal forces towards spin-orbit synchronization. We find suggestive empirical evidence for such a process in the present sample of transiting planetary systems. The corresponding angular momentum exchange would imply that some planets have spiralled towards their star by substantial amounts since the dissipation of the protoplanetary disc. We suggest that this could quantitatively account for the observed mass-period relation of close-in gas giants. We discuss how this scenario can be further tested and point out some consequences for theoretical studies of tidal interactions and for the detection and confirmation of transiting planets from radial velocity and photometric surveys.},

	abstract = {We report rotation periods for 20 cool (FGK) main sequence member stars 
of the 4 Gyr-old open cluster M67 (=NGC 2682), obtained by analyzing
data from Campaign 5 of the K2 mission with the Kepler Space Telescope.
The rotation periods delineate a sequence in the color-period
diagram (CPD) of increasing period with redder color. This sequence
represents a cross-section at the cluster age of the surface P = P(t,
M), suggested in prior work to extend to at least solar age. The current
Sun is located marginally (approximately 1σ) above M67 in the CPD,
as its relative age leads us to expect, and lies on the P = P(t, M)
surface to within measurement precision. We therefore conclude that the
solar rotation rate is normal as compared with cluster stars, a fact
that strengthens the solar-stellar connection. The agreement
between the M67 rotation period measurements and prior predictions
further implies that rotation periods, especially when coupled with
appropriate supporting work such as spectroscopy, can provide reliable
ages via gyrochronology for other similar FGK dwarfs from the early main
sequence to solar age and likely until the main sequence turnoff. The
M67 rotators have a rotational age of 4.2 Gyr with a standard deviation
of 0.7 Gyr, implying that similar field stars can be age-dated to
precisions of ˜17\%. The rotational age of the M67 cluster as a
whole is therefore 4.2 Gyr, but with a lower (averaged) uncertainty of
0.2 Gyr.},

The distribution of orbital eccentricity versus orbital period (e-logP) displays a distinct transition from eccentric to circular orbits at an orbital period of {\textasciitilde}10 days. The transition is due to tidal circularization of the closest binaries. The population of binary orbits in M35 provide a significantly improved constraint on the rate of tidal circularization at an age of 150 Myr. We propose a new and more robust diagnostic of the degree of tidal circularization in a binary population based on a functional fit to the e-logP distribution. We call this new measure the ``tidal circularization period.'' The tidal circularization period of a binary population represents the orbital period at which a binary orbit with the most frequent initial orbital eccentricity circularizes (defined as e=0.01) at the age of the population. We determine the tidal circularization period for M35, as well as for seven additional binary populations spanning ages from the pre-main sequence ({\textasciitilde}3 Myr) to the late main sequence ({\textasciitilde}10 Gyr), and use Monte Carlo error analysis to determine the uncertainties on the derived circularization periods. We conclude that current theories of tidal circularization cannot account for the distribution of tidal circularization periods with population age. WIYN Open Cluster Study XXII.},

	abstract = {Following on from a recently completed radial-velocity survey of the old 
(7 Gyr) open cluster NGC 188 in which we studied in detail the
solar-type hard binaries and blue stragglers of the cluster, here we
investigate the dynamical evolution of NGC 188 through a sophisticated
N-body model. Importantly, we employ the observed binary properties of
the young (180 Myr) open cluster M35, where possible, to guide our
choices for parameters of the initial binary population. We apply
pre-main-sequence tidal circularization and a substantial increase to
the main-sequence tidal circularization rate, both of which are
necessary to match the observed tidal circularization periods in the
literature, including that of NGC 188. At 7 Gyr the main-sequence
solar-type hard-binary population in the model matches that of NGC 188
in both binary frequency and distributions of orbital parameters. This
agreement between the model and observations is in a large part due to
the similarities between the NGC 188 and M35 solar-type binaries.
Indeed, among the 7 Gyr main-sequence binaries in the model, only those
with P {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 1000 days begin to show potentially observable evidence for
modifications by dynamical encounters, even after 7 Gyr of evolution
within the star cluster. This emphasizes the importance of defining
accurate initial conditions for star cluster models, which we propose is
best accomplished through comparisons with observations of young open
clusters like M35. Furthermore, this finding suggests that observations
of the present-day binaries in even old open clusters can provide
valuable information on their primordial binary populations. However,
despite the model's success at matching the observed solar-type
main-sequence population, the model underproduces blue stragglers and
produces an overabundance of long-period circular
main-sequence-white-dwarf binaries as compared with the true cluster. We
explore several potential solutions to the paucity of blue stragglers
and conclude that the model dramatically underproduces blue stragglers
through mass-transfer processes. We suggest that common-envelope
evolution may have been incorrectly imposed on the progenitors of the
spurious long-period circular main-sequence-white-dwarf binaries, which
perhaps instead should have gone through stable mass transfer to create
blue stragglers, thereby bringing both the number and binary frequency
of the blue straggler population in the model into agreement with the
true blue stragglers in NGC 188. Thus, improvements in the physics of
mass transfer and common-envelope evolution employed in the model may in
fact solve both discrepancies with the observations. This project
highlights the unique accessibility of open clusters to both
comprehensive observational surveys and full-scale N-body simulations,
both of which have only recently matured sufficiently to enable such a
project, and underscores the importance of open clusters to the study of
star cluster dynamics.

Conclusions: The calculated brightness temperature and the specific models suggest a highly inefficient redistribution of heat from the day-side to the night-side of the planet, and a consequent emission mainly from the day-side. The high-cadence ground-based technique is capable of detecting the faint signal of the secondary eclipse of extrasolar planets, which makes it a valuable complement to space-based mid-IR observations.

Additionally, the recent discovery of stellar binary companions 1” from WASP-12 has obfuscated interpretation of the observational data. Here we present new ground-based multi-object transmission-spectroscopy observations of WASP-12b that we acquired over two consecutive nights in the red optical with Gemini-N/GMOS. After correcting for the influence of WASP-12's stellar companions, we find that these data rule out a cloud-free H 2 atmosphere with no additional opacity sources. We detect features in the transmission spectrum that may be attributed to metal oxides (such as TiO and VO) for an O-rich atmosphere or to metal hydrides (such as TiH) for a C-rich atmosphere. We also reanalyzed NIR transit-spectroscopy observations of WASP-12b from HST /WFC3 and broadband transit photometry from Warm Spitzer . We attribute the broad spectral features in the WFC3 data to either H 2 O or CH 4 and HCN for an O-rich or C-rich atmosphere, respectively. The Spitzer data suggest shallower transit depths than the models predict at infrared wavelengths, albeit at low statistical significance. A multi-instrument, broad-wavelength analysis of WASP-12b suggests that the transmission spectrum is well approximated by a simple Rayleigh scattering model with a planet terminator temperature of 1870 ± 130 K. We conclude that additional high-precision data and isolated spectroscopic measurements of the companion stars are required to place definitive constraints on the composition of WASP-12b's atmosphere.},

	abstract = {I calculate the physical properties of 32 transiting extrasolar planet 
and brown-dwarf systems from existing photometric observations and
measured spectroscopic parameters. The systems studied include 15
observed by the CoRoT satellite, 10 by Kepler and five by the Deep
Impact spacecraft. Inclusion of the objects studied in previous papers
leads to a sample of 58 transiting systems with homogeneously measured
properties. The Kepler data include observations from Quarter 2, and my
analyses of several of the systems are the first to be based on
short-cadence data from this satellite.

The light curves are modelled using the JKTEBOP code, with attention
paid to the treatment of limb darkening, contaminating light, orbital
eccentricity, correlated noise and numerical integration over long
exposure times. The physical properties are derived from the light-curve
parameters, spectroscopic characteristics of the host star and
constraints from five sets of theoretical stellar model predictions. An
alternative approach using a calibration from eclipsing binary star
systems is explored and found to give comparable results whilst imposing
a much smaller computational burden.

My results are in good agreement with published properties for most of
the transiting systems, but discrepancies are identified for CoRoT-5,
CoRoT-8, CoRoT-13, Kepler-5 and Kepler-7. Many of the error bars quoted
in the literature are underestimated. Refined orbital ephemerides are
given for CoRoT-8 and for the Kepler planets. Asteroseismic constraints
on the density of the host stars are in good agreement with the
photometric equivalents for HD 17156 and TrES-2, but not for HAT-P-7 and
HAT-P-11.

Complete error budgets are generated for each transiting system,
allowing identification of the observations best-suited to improve
measurements of their physical properties. Whilst most systems would
benefit from further photometry and spectroscopy, HD 17156, HD 80606,
HAT-P-7 and TrES-2 are now extremely well characterized. HAT-P-11 is an
exceptional candidate for studying starspots. The orbital ephemerides of
some transiting systems are becoming uncertain and they should be
re-observed in the near future.

The primary results from the current work and from previous papers in
the series have been placed in an online catalogue, from where they can
be obtained in a range of formats for reference and further study.

	abstract = {Io is the volcanically most active body in the Solar System and has a large surface heat flux. The geological activity is thought to be the result of tides raised by Jupiter, but it is not known whether the current tidal heat production is sufficiently high to generate the observed surface heat flow. Io's tidal heat comes from the orbital energy of the Io-Jupiter system (resulting in orbital acceleration), whereas dissipation of energy in Jupiter causes Io's orbital motion to decelerate. Here we report a determination of the tidal dissipation in Io and Jupiter through its effect on the orbital motions of the Galilean moons. Our results show that the rate of internal energy dissipation in Io (k2/Q = 0.015+/-0.003, where k2 is the Love number and Q is the quality factor) is in good agreement with the observed surface heat flow, and suggest that Io is close to thermal equilibrium. Dissipation in Jupiter (k2/Q =
(1.102+/-0.203)×10-5) is close to the upper bound of
its average value expected from the long-term evolution of the system, and dissipation in extrasolar planets may be higher than presently assumed. The measured secular accelerations indicate that Io is evolving inwards, towards Jupiter, and that the three innermost Galilean moons (Io, Europa and Ganymede) are evolving out of the exact Laplace
resonance.},

The presence or absence of specific changes is used to bound the values of Q (the specific dissipation function) appropriate for the planets and satellites. It is shown that the values of Q separate sharply into two groups. Values in the range from 10 to 500 are found for the terrestrial planets and satellites of the major planets. On the other hand, Q for the major planets is always larger than 6 × 10 4. Estimates of tidal dissipation in the atmospheres of the Jovian planets lead to values of Q which are consistent with those we have calculated on the basis of secular changes in the satellites' orbits. However, it is difficult to reconcile these large Q's with the much smaller values obtained in laboratory tests of solids. Lyttleton's hypothesis that Pluto is an escaped satellite of Neptune is critically examined. Using the Q's we obtain for the major planets and their satellites, we show that any eccentricity that Triton's orbit may have possessed after a near encounter with Pluto would have been subsequently damped, thus accounting for its present near-circular orbit.},

	abstract = {The negligible eccentricity of all extrasolar planets with periods less than 6 days can be accounted for by dissipation of tidal disturbances within their envelopes that are induced by their host stars. In the period range of 7-21 days, planets with circular orbits coexist with planets with eccentric orbits. These are referred to as the borderline planets. We propose that this discrepancy can be attributed to the variation in spin-down rates of young stars. In particular, prior to spin-down, dissipation of a planet's tidal disturbance within the envelope of a sufficiently rapidly spinning star can excite eccentricity growth and, for a more slowly spinning star, at least reduce the eccentricity-damping rate. In contrast, tidal dissipation within the envelope of a slowly spinning low-mass mature star can enhance the eccentricity-damping process. On the basis of these results, we suggest that short-period planets around relatively young stars may have a much larger dispersion in eccentricity than those around mature stars. We also suggest that because the rate of angular momentum loss from G and K dwarfs via stellar winds is much faster than the tidal transfer of angular momentum between themselves and their very short (3-4 days) period planets, they cannot establish a dynamical configuration in which the stellar and planetary spins are approximately parallel and synchronous with the orbital frequency. In principle, however, such configurations may be established for planets (around G and K dwarfs) with orbital periods of up to several weeks. In contrast to G and K dwarfs, the angular momentum loss due to stellar winds is much weaker in F dwarfs. It is therefore possible for synchronized short-period planets to exist around such stars. The planet around Tau Boo is one such example.},

	abstract = {We have analysed radial velocity measurements for known transiting exoplanets to study the empirical signature of tidal orbital evolution for close-in planets. Compared to standard eccentricity determination, our approach is modified to focus on the rejection of the null hypothesis of a circular orbit. We are using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of radial velocity measurements and photometric constraints, including a component of correlated noise, as well as Bayesian model selection to check if the data justify the additional complexity of an eccentric orbit. We find that among planets with non-zero eccentricity values quoted in the literature, there is no evidence for an eccentricity detection for the seven planets CoRoT-5b, WASP-5b, WASP-6b, WASP-10b, WASP-12b, WASP-17b and WASP-18b. In contrast, we confirm the eccentricity of HAT-P-16b, e= 0.034 ± 0.003, the smallest eccentricity that is reliably measured so far for an exoplanet as well as that of WASP-14b, which is the planet at the shortest period (P= 2.24 d), with a confirmed eccentricity, e= 0.088 ± 0.003. As part of the study, we present new radial velocity data using the HARPS spectrograph for CoRoT-1, CoRoT-3, WASP-2, WASP-4, WASP-5 and WASP-7 as well as the SOPHIE spectrograph for HAT-P-4, HAT-P-7, TrES-2 and XO-2. We show that the dissipative effect of tides raised in the planet by the star and vice versa explain all the eccentricity and spin-orbit alignment measurements available for transiting planets. We revisit the mass-period relation and consider its relation to the stopping mechanism of orbital migration for hot Jupiters. In addition to CoRoT-2 and HD 189733, we find evidence for excess rotation of the star in the systems CoRoT-18, HAT-P-20, WASP-19 and WASP-43.},

Both the tides the planet raises on the star and vice versa are important and dissipation efficiencies ranging over four orders of magnitude are being used. In addition, the discovery of extrasolar planets extremely close to their stars has made it clear that the estimates of the tidal quality factor, Q , of the stars based on Jupiter and its satellite system and on main-sequence binary star observations are too low, resulting in lifetimes for the closest planets orders of magnitude smaller than their age. We argue that those estimates of the tidal dissipation efficiency are not applicable for stars with spin periods much longer than the extrasolar planets' orbital period. We address the problem by applying our own values for the dissipation efficiency of tides, based on our numerical simulations of externally perturbed volumes of stellar-like convection. The range of dissipation we find for main-sequence stars corresponds to stellar Q * of 10 8 to 3 × 10 9 . The derived orbit lifetimes are comparable to or much longer than the ages of the observed extrasolar planetary systems. The predicted orbital decay transit timing variations due to the tidal coupling are below the rate of ms yr –1 for currently known systems, but within reach of an extended Kepler mission provided such objects are found in its field.},

The tidal quality parameter of the host star was found to be equal to 2.5 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, which is similar to theoretical predictions for Sun-like stars.

	abstract = {As the quality and quantity of astrophysical data continue to improve, the precision with which certain astrophysical events can be timed becomes limited not by the data themselves, but by the manner, standard, and uniformity with which time itself is referenced. While some areas of astronomy (most notably pulsar studies) have required absolute time stamps with precisions of considerably better than 1 minute for many decades, recently new areas have crossed into this regime. In particular, in the exoplanet community, we have found that the (typically unspecified) time standards adopted by various groups can differ by as much as a minute. Left uncorrected, this ambiguity may be mistaken for transit timing variations and bias eccentricity measurements. We argue that, since the commonly-used Julian Date, as well as its heliocentric and barycentric counterparts, can be specified in several time standards, it is imperative that their time standards always be reported when accuracies of 1 minute are required. We summarize the rationale behind our recommendation to quote the site arrival time, in addition to using BJD\_TDB, the Barycentric Julian Date in the Barycentric Dynamical Time standard for any astrophysical event. The BJD\_TDB is the most practical absolute time stamp for extra-terrestrial phenomena, and is ultimately limited by the properties of the target system. We compile a general summary of factors that must be considered in order to achieve timing precisions ranging from 15 minutes to 1 microsecond. Finally, we provide software tools that, in principal, allow one to calculate BJD\_TDB to a precision of 1 microsecond for any target from anywhere on Earth or from any spacecraft.},

Here we investigate how systemic proper motion, which steadily re-orients planetary orbit with respect to our line of sight, affects the timing of transits. We find that in a typical system with a period of several days, proper motion at the level of 100 mas yr –1 makes transit duration vary at a rate 10-100 ms yr –1 . In some isolated systems this variation is at the measurable level (can be as high as 0.6 s yr –1 for GJ436) and may exceed all other transit-timing contributions (due to the general relativity, stellar quadrupole, etc.). In addition, proper motion causes evolution of the observed period between transits P obs via the Shklovskii effect at a rate \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] gsim 10 μs yr –1 for the nearby transiting systems (0.26 ms yr –1 in GJ436), which in some cases exceeds all other contributions to \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/700/2/965/apj300415ieqn1.gif] \${\textbackslash}dotP\_{\textbackslash}rm obs\$ . Earth's motion around the Sun gives rise to additional periodic timing signal (even for systems with zero intrinsic proper motion) allowing a full determination of the spatial orientation of the planetary orbit. Unlike most other timing effects, the proper motion signatures persist even in systems with zero eccentricity and get stronger as the planetary period increases. They should be the dominant cause of transit-timing variations in isolated wide-separation (periods of months) systems that will be sought by Kepler .},

	abstract = {We have analysed radial velocity measurements for known transiting exoplanets to study the empirical signature of tidal orbital evolution for close-in planets. Compared to standard eccentricity determination, our approach is modified to focus on the rejection of the null hypothesis of a circular orbit. We are using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of radial velocity measurements and photometric constraints, including a component of correlated noise, as well as Bayesian model selection to check if the data justify the additional complexity of an eccentric orbit. We find that among planets with non-zero eccentricity values quoted in the literature, there is no evidence for an eccentricity detection for the seven planets CoRoT-5b, WASP-5b, WASP-6b, WASP-10b, WASP-12b, WASP-17b and WASP-18b. In contrast, we confirm the eccentricity of HAT-P-16b, e= 0.034 ± 0.003, the smallest eccentricity that is reliably measured so far for an exoplanet as well as that of WASP-14b, which is the planet at the shortest period (P= 2.24 d), with a confirmed eccentricity, e= 0.088 ± 0.003. As part of the study, we present new radial velocity data using the HARPS spectrograph for CoRoT-1, CoRoT-3, WASP-2, WASP-4, WASP-5 and WASP-7 as well as the SOPHIE spectrograph for HAT-P-4, HAT-P-7, TrES-2 and XO-2. We show that the dissipative effect of tides raised in the planet by the star and vice versa explain all the eccentricity and spin-orbit alignment measurements available for transiting planets. We revisit the mass-period relation and consider its relation to the stopping mechanism of orbital migration for hot Jupiters. In addition to CoRoT-2 and HD 189733, we find evidence for excess rotation of the star in the systems CoRoT-18, HAT-P-20, WASP-19 and WASP-43.},

We present new radial velocity observations for a sample of 51 planets obtained using the Keck HIRES instrument, and find statistically significant accelerations in fifteen systems. Six of these systems have no previously reported accelerations in the published literature: HAT-P-10, HAT-P-22, HAT-P-29, HAT-P-32, WASP-10, and XO-2. We combine our radial velocity fits with Keck NIRC2 adaptive optics (AO) imaging data to place constraints on the allowed masses and orbital periods of the companions responsible for the detected accelerations. The estimated masses of the companions range between 1-500 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, with orbital semi-major axes typically between 1-75 AU. A significant majority of the companions detected by our survey are constrained to have minimum masses comparable to or larger than those of the transiting planets in these systems, making them candidates for influencing the orbital evolution of the inner gas giant. We estimate a total occurrence rate of 51\% ± 10\% for companions with masses between 1-13 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and orbital semi-major axes between 1-20 AU in our sample. We find no statistically significant difference between the frequency of companions to transiting planets with misaligned or eccentric orbits and those with well-aligned, circular orbits. We combine our expanded sample of radial velocity measurements with constraints from transit and secondary eclipse observations to provide improved measurements of the physical and orbital characteristics of all of the planets included in our survey.},

One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to ˜N2 for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our

	abstract = {We present exact analytic formulae for the eclipse of a star described by quadratic or nonlinear limb darkening. In the limit that the planet radius is less than a tenth of the stellar radius, we show that the exact lightcurve can be well approximated by assuming the region of the star blocked by the planet has constant surface brightness. We apply these results to the HST observations of HD 209458, showing that the ratio of the planetary to stellar radii is 0.1207+-0.0003. These formulae give a fast and accurate means of computing lightcurves using limb-darkening coefficients from model atmospheres which should aid in the detection, simulation, and parameter fitting of planetary transits.},

These coefficients can be used in many different fields of stellar physics as synthetic light curves of eclipsing binaries and planetary transits, stellar diameters, line profiles in rotating stars, and others. The limb-darkening coefficients were computed specifically for the photometric system of the space mission TESS and were performed by adopting the least-square method. In addition, the linear and bi-parametric coefficients, by adopting the flux conservation method, are also available. On the other hand, to take into account the effects of tidal and rotational distortions, we computed the passband gravity-darkening coefficients \$y({\textbackslash}lambda)\$ using a general differential equation in which we consider the effects of convection and of the partial derivative \${\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}partial\{{\textbackslash}ln I({\textbackslash}lambda)\}/\{{\textbackslash}partial\{{\textbackslash}ln g\}\}{\textbackslash}right)\_\{T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\}\$. To generate the limb-darkening coefficients we adopt two stellar atmosphere models: ATLAS (plane-parallel) and PHOENIX (spherical, quasi-spherical, and \$r\$-method). The specific intensity distribution was fitted using five approaches: linear, quadratic, square root, logarithmic, and a more general one with four terms. These grids cover together 19 metallicities ranging from 10\${\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$ up to 10\${\textasciicircum}\{+1\}\$ solar abundances, 0 \${\textbackslash}leq\$ log g \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 6.0 and 1500 K \${\textbackslash}leq\$ T\$\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 50000 K.

The algorithm searches for signals characterized by a periodic alternation between two discrete levels, with much less time spent at the lower level. We present numerical as well as analytical results to predict the possible detection significance at various signal parameters. It is shown that the crucial parameter is the effective signal-to-noise ratio - the expected depth of the transit divided by the standard deviation of the measured photometric average within the transit. When this parameter exceeds the value of 6 we can expect a significant detection of the transit. We show that the box-fitting algorithm performs better than other methods available in the astronomical literature, especially for low signal-to-noise ratios.},

Here, we analyze the sample of all 188 known HJs with an orbital period {\textless}3.5 days and a “cool” host star ( T eff {\textless} 6100 K).

This helps to resolve a number of apparent discrepancies between studies of tidal dissipation in binary stars, HJs, and warm Jupiters.

We have used the data to refine the estimates of the system parameters and ephemerides. During two of the transits we observed a short-lived, low-amplitude anomaly that we interpret as the occultation of a starspot by the planet. We also found evidence for a pair of similar anomalies in previously published photometry. The recurrence of these anomalies suggests that the stellar rotation axis is nearly aligned with the orbital axis, or else the starspot would not have remained on the transit chord. By analyzing the timings of the anomalies we find the sky-projected stellar obliquity to be λ = -1{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+14{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}- 12{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} degrees. This result is consistent with (and more constraining than) a recent observation of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It suggests that the planet migration mechanism preserved the initially low obliquity, or else that tidal evolution has realigned the system. Future applications of this method using data from the CoRoT and Kepler missions will allow spin-orbit alignment to be probed for many other exoplanets.

We find secondary eclipse depths of 0.319\% ± 0.031\% and 0.343\% ± 0.027\% for the 3.6 and 4.5 μm bands, respectively, and show model emission spectra and pressure-temperature profiles for the planetary atmosphere. These eclipse depths are well fit by model emission spectra with water and other molecules in absorption, similar to those used for TrES-3 and HD 189733b. Depending on our choice of model, these results indicate that this planet has either a weak dayside temperature inversion or no inversion at all. The absence of a strong thermal inversion on this highly irradiated planet is contrary to the idea that highly irradiated planets are expected to have inversions, perhaps due the presence of an unknown absorber in the upper atmosphere. This result might be explained by the modestly enhanced activity level of WASP-4b's G7V host star, which could increase the amount of UV flux received by the planet, therefore reducing the abundance of the unknown stratospheric absorber in the planetary atmosphere as suggested in Knutson et al. We also find no evidence for an offset in the timing of the secondary eclipse and place a 2σ upper limit on {\textbar} e cos ω{\textbar} of 0.0024, which constrains the range of tidal heating models that could explain this planet's inflated radius.},

For WASP-4, the new estimates for the planet radius and mass from a combined analysis of our VLT data with previously published transit photometry and radial velocities are Rp =
1.30+0.05-0.04 RJ and Mp = 1.21+0.13-0.08 M\_J, resulting in a density ρp = 0.55+0.04-0.02 ρ\_J. The

0.85+0.11-0.07 M\_⊙. Our ground-based
photometry reaches 550 ppm at time sampling of {\textasciitilde}50 s. Nevertheless, we also report the presence of an instrumental effect on the VLT that degraded our photometry for the WASP-5 observations. This effect could be a major problem for similar programs. Our new estimates for the parameters of the WASP-5 system are Rp = 1.09 ± 0.07

We have used the data to refine the estimates of the system parameters and ephemerides. During two of the transits we observed a short-lived, low-amplitude anomaly that we interpret as the occultation of a starspot by the planet. We also found evidence for a pair of similar anomalies in previously published photometry. The recurrence of these anomalies suggests that the stellar rotation axis is nearly aligned with the orbital axis, or else the starspot would not have remained on the transit chord. By analyzing the timings of the anomalies we find the sky-projected stellar obliquity to be λ = -1{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+14{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}- 12{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} degrees. This result is consistent with (and more constraining than) a recent observation of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. It suggests that the planet migration mechanism preserved the initially low obliquity, or else that tidal evolution has realigned the system. Future applications of this method using data from the CoRoT and Kepler missions will allow spin-orbit alignment to be probed for many other exoplanets.

Ground-based simultaneous multiband transit observations allow an accurate system parameter determination and may lead to the detection and characterization of additional bodies via the transit timing variations (TTVs) method. Aims: We aim to (i) characterize the heavily bloated WASP-4b hot Jupiter and its star by measuring system parameters and the dependence of the planetary radius as a function of four (Sloan g', r', i', z') wavelengths and (ii) search for TTVs. Methods: We recorded 987 images during three complete transits with the GROND instrument, mounted on the MPG/ESO-2.2 m telescope at La Silla Observatory. Assuming a quadratic law for the stellar limb-darkening, we derived the system parameters by simultaneous fitting a composite transit light curve over all bandpasses. To compute uncertainties of the fitted parameters, we employed the bootstrap Monte Carlo method. Results: The three central transit times are measured with precision down to 6 s. We find a planetary radius Rp = 1.413 ±
0.020 RJup, an orbital inclination i = 88.57 ° ±
0.45° and calculate a new ephemeris, a period P = 1.33823144

	abstract = {Context. Several competing scenarios for planetary-system formation and evolution seek to explain how hot Jupiters came to be so close to their parent stars. Most planetary parameters evolve with time, making it hard to distinguish between models. The obliquity of an orbit with respect to the stellar rotation axis is thought to be more stable than other parameters such as eccentricity. Most planets, to date, appear aligned with the stellar rotation axis; the few misaligned planets so far detected are massive (\&gt; 2 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}J{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}). {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Our goal is to measure the degree of alignment between planetary orbits and stellar spin axes, to search for potential correlations with eccentricity or other planetary parameters and to measure long term radial velocity variability indicating the presence of other bodies in the system. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: For transiting planets, the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect allows the measurement of the sky-projected angle β between the stellar rotation axis and a planet's orbital axis. Using the HARPS spectrograph, we observed the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for six transiting hot Jupiters found by the WASP consortium. We combine these with long term radial velocity measurements obtained with CORALIE. We used a combined analysis of photometry and radial velocities, fitting model parameters with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. After obtaining β we attempt to statistically determine the distribution of the real spin-orbit angle ψ. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We found that three of our targets have β above 90°: WASP-2b: β = 153°{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+11{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-15{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, WASP-15b: β = 139.6°{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+5.2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-4.3{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and WASP-17b: β = 148.5°{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+5.1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-4.2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}; the other three (WASP-4b, WASP-5b and WASP-18b) have angles compatible with 0°. We find no dependence between the misaligned angle and planet mass nor with any other planetary parameter. All six orbits are close to circular, with only one firm detection of eccentricity e = 0.00848{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.00085{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.00095{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} in WASP-18b. No long-term radial acceleration was detected for any of the targets. Combining all previous 20 measurements of β and our six and transforming them into a distribution of ψ we find that between about 45 and 85\% of hot Jupiters have ψ \&gt; 30°. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Most hot Jupiters are misaligned, with a large variety of spin-orbit angles. We find observations and predictions using the Kozai mechanism match well. If these observational facts are confirmed in the future, we may then conclude that most hot Jupiters are formed from a dynamical and tidal origin without the necessity to use type I or II migration. At present, standard disc migration cannot explain the observations without invoking at least another additional process.

Jupiter exoplanets using the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3
(WFC3) instrument. We use the G141 grism (1.1-1.7 μm) to study
TrES-2b, TrES-4b, and CoRoT-1b in transit; TrES-3b in secondary eclipse;
and WASP-4b in both. This wavelength region includes a predicted
absorption feature from water at 1.4 μm, which we expect to be
nondegenerate with the other molecules that are likely to be abundant
for hydrocarbon-poor (e.g., solar composition) hot Jupiter atmospheres.
We divide our wavelength regions into 10 bins. For each bin we produce a
spectrophotometric light curve spanning the time of transit or eclipse.
We correct these light curves for instrumental systematics without
reference to an instrument model. For our transmission spectra, our mean
1σ precision per bin corresponds to variations of 2.1, 2.8, and
3.0 atmospheric scale heights for TrES-2b, TrES-4b, and CoRoT-1b,
respectively. We find featureless spectra for these three planets. We
are unable to extract a robust transmission spectrum for WASP-4b. For
our dayside emission spectra, our mean 1σ precision per bin
corresponds to a planet-to-star flux ratio of 1.5 ×
10-4 and 2.1 × 10-4 for WASP-4b and TrES-3b,
respectively. We combine these estimates with previous broadband
measurements and conclude that for both planets isothermal atmospheres
are disfavored. We find no signs of features due to water. We confirm
that WFC3 is suitable for studies of transiting exoplanets, but in
staring mode multivisit campaigns are necessary to place strong
constraints on water abundance.},

Gemini Multi-Object Spectrometers (GMOS); this is the first result from
a comparative exoplanetology survey program of close-in gas giants
conducted with GMOS. WASP-4b has an equilibrium temperature of 1700 K
and is favorable to study in transmission due to its large scale height
(370 km). We derive the transmission spectrum of WASP-4b using four
transits observed with the MOS technique. We demonstrate repeatable
results across multiple epochs with GMOS, and derive a combined
transmission spectrum at a precision about twice above photon noise,
which is roughly equal to one atmospheric scale height. The transmission
spectrum is well fitted with a uniform opacity as a function of
wavelength. The uniform opacity and absence of a Rayleigh slope from
molecular hydrogen suggest that the atmosphere is dominated by clouds
with condensate grain sizes of ˜1 μm. This result is consistent
with previous observations of hot Jupiters since clouds have been seen
in planets with similar equilibrium temperatures to WASP-4b. We describe
a custom pipeline that we have written to reduce GMOS time-series data
of exoplanet transits, and present a thorough analysis of the dominant
noise sources in GMOS, which primarily consist of wavelength- and
time-dependent displacements of the spectra on the detector, mainly due
to a lack of atmospheric dispersion correction.},

It will obtain 30 minute cadence observations of all objects in the TESS fields of view, along with two-minute cadence observations of 200,000–400,000 selected stars. The choice of which stars to observe at the two-minute cadence is driven by the need to detect small transiting planets, which leads to the selection of primarily bright, cool dwarfs. We describe the catalogs assembled and the algorithms used to populate the TESS Input Catalog (TIC), including plans to update the TIC with the incorporation of the Gaia second data release in the near future. We also describe a ranking system for prioritizing stars according to the smallest transiting planet detectable, and assemble a Candidate Target List (CTL) using that ranking. We discuss additional factors that affect the ability to photometrically detect and dynamically confirm small planets, and we note additional stellar populations of interest that may be added to the final target list.

	abstract = {Several authors have shown that precise measurements of transit time variations of exoplanets can be sensitive to other planetary bodies, such as exo-moons. In addition, the transit timing variations of the exoplanets closest to their host stars can provide tests of tidal dissipation theory. These studies, however, have not considered the effect of the host star. There is a large body of observational evidence that eclipse times of binary stars can vary dramatically due to variations in the quadrupole moment of the stars driven by stellar activity. In this paper, we investigate and estimate the likely impact such variations have on the transit times of exoplanets. We find in several cases that such variations should be detectable. In particular, the estimated period changes for WASP-18b are of the same order as those expected for tidal dissipation, even for relatively low values of the tidal dissipation parameter. The transit time variations caused by the Applegate mechanism are also of the correct magnitude and occur on time-scales such that they may be confused with variations caused by light-travel time effects due to the presence of a Jupiter-like second planet. Finally, we suggest that transiting exoplanet systems may provide a clean route (compared to binaries) to constraining the type of dynamo operating in the host star.},
